                        Thought I'd share with you guys the details of some upcoming events 
that might be of interest to letterboxers as similar activities.

The Marlborough treasure hunt is on again this year, 3rd of June...

                        Hi there guys,

I've been a bad geocacher and letterboxer lately and want to cut down

post it...

After 
reading Ryan's email the other day, I decided on a belated New Year's resolution 
- to place a box a month in 2006. And I challenge you all to do the
