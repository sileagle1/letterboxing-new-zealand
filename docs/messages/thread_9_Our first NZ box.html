All - well we're back from a road trip up to Tauranga - we wanted to place a 
number of boxes but the weather and limited time meant we only got to place one

Caves) - the first we've found in over 10 months (talk about extreme 
deprivation!!!).</font></span></div>

My partner and I will hopefully be doing some placings in the Wellington<br/>

I've been so blown away by some pictures I've seen of stamps from the USA.<br/>
One set of Alice in Wonderland themed stamps was incredible - the stamps<br/>
printed looked like printers plate quality.  I'm guessing the trick would be<br/>
to get a bigger area to carve and then practice LOTS.<br/>

</span></blockquote>Yeah well the IALC gals are over-achievers :-)<br/>
I never got round to finishing my contribution to Alice - was too busy<br/>
trying to move country instead. They do use larger carving blocks - the<br/>
stuff they make the Mars erasers from can be bought in enourmous blocks. The<br/>
"pink stuff" material also comes in largish sheets. I don't know if you can<br/>
get them here, but if you're keen you could order it from Dick Blick's<br/>
online arts store. But I suggest working with erasers for a while until you<br/>
get the hang of it. Some letterbox series are based on multiple erasers -<br/>
you stamp them next to each other (or sometimes on top of each other) to<br/>
build up a larger picture.<br/>
<br/>
Some of the IALC gals get the fine detail by using body-piercing needles.<br/>
I've got some but am still figuring out how to use them without impaling<br/>
myself.<br/>
<br/>
Glad to see you joined IALC - we need more international members!! But have<br/>
you got your purple socks yet??<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
