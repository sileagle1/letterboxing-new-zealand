<br/>
We're seriously considering a 3-week vacation trip to New Zealand (late <br/>
NOV - early DEC).  We're just starting our research, but will <br/>
definitely plan to find as many letterboxes as possible and do lots of <br/>
hiking while we are there.  <br/>
<br/>
We would really appreciate any suggestions that any of you might have <br/>
regarding great places to hike, as well as any other "must see" spots.<br/>
