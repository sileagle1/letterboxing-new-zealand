March.  We would like to find several letterboxes while we're <br/>
there.   Any suggestions as to which ones?  We are obviously not <br/>
familiar with any of the areas the boxes are in.  We will be <br/>
visiting as many places as time will allow us, and if any are near <br/>
tourist spots, or main cities, that information would be helpful. <br/>
And any other information about visiting your beautiful country <br/>
would be appreciated!  Are there any Lord of the Rings boxes?  If <br/>
there are, great!  If not, maybe I'll just have to place one!  <br/>
Thanks for your help.<br/>

<br/>
That is really exciting news.  I hope that we'll be able to meet up and have<br/>
an "exchange".  I live in Wellington.<br/>
<br/>
Do you know yet which cities or areas you'll be travelling through?  If you<br/>
are following the main highway (state highway 1) which runs the length of<br/>
the country, you will pass within 25km's of (currently) 23 "published"<br/>
boxes.  There are currently a further 11 boxes slightly further afield.<br/>
Psychokiwi helped the Atlasquest site to develop a trip planner which will<br/>
show you this information.<br/>
<br/>
You've got a whole month so you should be able to see lots!  There aren't<br/>
many boxes in the bottom half of the South island yet, which is a shame<br/>
because that is beautiful country but I'm sure you'd still enjoy checking it<br/>
out. What sort of non-letterboxing interests do you have?  Perhaps that'd<br/>
give us an idea of what advice would help.<br/>
<br/>
The only LOTR box that I'm aware of is actually one of my own.  It is called<br/>
Isengard Gardens and is located at the film location for filming scenes of<br/>
Isengard Gardens, approx half and hours drive from central Wellington.  The<br/>
stamp is not particulary artisitic but is themed appropriately and I made it<br/>
myself.<br/>
There are quite a few LOTR themed geocaches if you are into geocaching too.<br/>
<br/>
Let us know what other sort of info you need and I'm sure we'll all be keen<br/>
to help.  Everyone on this forum is really friendly.<br/>

and exchange.  I have a box that I would love to leave <br/>
there. . .either with a person, or hide myself.  And if anyone wants <br/>
one to be hidden back in the US, we'd be more than happy to do that, <br/>
also.  We are looking to do a lot of hiking, camping, and adventure <br/>
sports, so if you have any ideas, we're completely open!  Thanks for <br/>
all your help. I'll look on AtlasQuest too.  Hope to hear back from <br/>
you soon.<br/>
