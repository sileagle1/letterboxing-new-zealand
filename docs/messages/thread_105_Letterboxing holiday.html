<br/>
Dartmoor was wonderful and we had a lot of fun staying there and hiking<br/>
around. We weren't good at finding boxes using the usual style of British<br/>
clue, which involves lining up features with a compass.  We had quite a bit<br/>
of success though with some boxes for which the clues had very precise map<br/>
grid references - then we could use our gps unit to help in the search.<br/>
<br/>
The Dartmoor area is very beautiful, and we saw lots of "wild" ponies and<br/>
moorland grazing sheep.  We learnt a lot about the area, the small towns,<br/>
the narrow lanes, the natural and man made rock features...  We also enjoyed<br/>
very much boxing at pubs, where asking for a box is an excellent excuse to<br/>
have a pub lunch, desert or drink.<br/>
<br/>
As well as boxing on Dartmoor we were also able to find a box in Edinburgh,<br/>
and one in Prague, there were also several boxes I couldn't find in Paris.<br/>
We also found Geocaches in many of the places we visited.<br/>
<br/>
I'll put some photos into the yahoo folder.  Hopefully I can catch up with<br/>
some of your guys, as I can't wait to "show off" my logbook :-)<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
