holidays once we get our stamps made.  I realise some of the areas may <br/>
not welcome dogs though.  Is there any way to know in advance?  <br/>
<br/>
Perhaps we will have to create our own letterboxes?<br/>

<br/>
Glad to hear from someone keen to get started on letterboxing.  Where <br/>
are you based?<br/>
<br/>
AtlasQuest, which contains the clues to most NZ letterboxes has a 'pet <br/>
friendly' search criteria which means it's located in an area that <br/>
allows pets to roam, usually with a leash requirement.  We've always <br/>
marked our boxes with this criteria if they're suitable for dogs,and <br/>
hopefully most others have as well.<br/>
<br/>
We've recently got a puppy who we'll start to take on some of our <br/>
letterboxing adventures, so we'll also be looking out for dog friendly <br/>
boxes from now on.<br/>
