<br/>
I'm in Colorado (USA) and have visited the board once or twice <br/>
although I usually just lurk around in the shadows and read. :)<br/>
<br/>
Would anyone here be interested in a box exchange with me?  I and a <br/>
friend have both done boxes that we would love to send over to be <br/>
placed there.... and would also really enjoy receiving boxes to <br/>
plant here!   Our boxes would be to do with our area... Colorado <br/>
subjects.  Your boxes could be anything at all that you want.  I'm <br/>
in Grand Junction and he is in Durango...we can place in both spots. <br/>
<br/>
If anyone wants to play foreign exchange just shout and I'll box up <br/>
our offerings (and can send carving materials or anything else <br/>
that's easier to find here) and shoost it to you!<br/>
<br/>
I'm planning on a visit NZ next year and will plant boxes then, but <br/>
I'd really like send these two first.  Let me know!<br/>

hiding places here &amp; in the South Island...so if you're thinking of <br/>
visiting Christchurch you could have a hunt for them when you get <br/>

Christchurch also has a lot of geocaches, if you're into that (now, <br/>
if only we could get more geocachers into letterboxing....).<br/>

Would the swap be of a log book and stamp?  That would be the cheapest way<br/>
to post them.  Then we could put them into a box when they arrive.<br/>
<br/>
I'd be happy to send you a log book and stamp of my own creation (and New<br/>
Zealand themed).<br/>
<br/>
I'm not very good at hiding.  Hmm...Actually, maybe my fiance Michael could<br/>
hide one for you, he is not so keen on making up boxes, but he LOVES writing<br/>
clues and finding hidey spots.<br/>

Please email me (ChauceyMc at Yahoo dot Co dot NZ ) with your address<br/>

We'd love to do an exchange with you!  Carving is not our strong <br/>
point so we can't promise very exciting stamps (although we will <br/>
try!) but we can promise to find a really great hiding place here for <br/>
yours... if you still have any left!<br/>
<br/>
We're of the same view as Chaucey, just send the stamp and log book, <br/>
and we can supply the box, if that helps on postage.  Let us know.<br/>
