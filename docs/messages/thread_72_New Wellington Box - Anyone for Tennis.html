<br/>
I placed a new Wellington box today.  It's called "Anyone for <br/>
tennis?" and is in Brooklyn, Wellington.  Clues are at atlasquest.  <br/>
Again, please BYO stamp pad - I'd reccommend a yellow or bright green <br/>
for this one.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I went and checked on Karori Capers and it is still snug and <br/>
dry (unlike my feet after fording the wee river).<br/>
<br/>
