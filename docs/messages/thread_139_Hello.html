<br/>
I thought I'd better say hello. My name is Michelle. A friend of mine <br/>
in the US has been talking about letterboxing for the last year or so <br/>
and it sounded interesting so I thought I'd give it a go.<br/>
<br/>
A couple of weeks ago my friend Shalagh and I found our first <br/>
letterbox. Unfortunately in our excitement to get out we forgot to <br/>
stop and buy a notebook and a stamp (I plan on making one at some <br/>
point). Once we have a little notebook and stamp in hand we plan to go <br/>
again and with any luck get our husbands and kids involved.<br/>
<br/>
I live in near Wellington and see that there are a few to find.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>

There are also 2 boxes in Napier that I've yet to do the clues for (my<br/>
bad!) that were planted a couple of months ago.<br/>
<br/>
As you plan your itinerary, if you go to Atlas Quest<br/>
(http://www.atlasquest.com), you can use the trip planner to find<br/>
boxes within a certain distance of all of New Zealand's State Highways<br/>
(scroll down past the USA routes to get to NZ). It doesn't pick up<br/>
mystery boxes though.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you're bringing some boxes with you to plant too! If you don't<br/>
want to fill up your luggage with boxes, you can buy plastic boxes in<br/>
a variety of sizes here at any supermarket. The best brand seems to be<br/>
systema as they have a rubber ring in the lid to make a water-tight seal. <br/>
<br/>
And a word of warning - come prepared for any type of weather as it<br/>
can change rapidly. This can be a problem if you're out hiking (even<br/>
for the day). Bring good boots and good wet-weather gear (or get some<br/>
here). Look for merino-wool and possum-wool clothing in the touristy<br/>
shops - it's light and very warm (and you're helping save NZ forests<br/>
by creating a market for dead possums). Always make sure you have food<br/>
and water - many of the rivers now have the Giardia bug so you can't<br/>
drink from them. There is no food in NZ bush - unless you like fern<br/>
roots (yuck!). Most of the berries are poisonous. But we don't have<br/>
snakes, ticks, or other nasties, so there's one plus for you. Also, if<br/>
you bring a compass, make sure it's a "world-wide" compass - the<br/>
cheaper ones usually work only in specific parts of the world (due to<br/>
how the magnetic fields lie) - the needle does funny things in this<br/>
hemisphere!<br/>
<br/>
Happy travels!<br/>

</span></blockquote>Oh yes, we're familiar with those.  We're good researchers and have <br/>
found over 2,000 boxes (&amp; planted nearly 100), so I guess you could <br/>
call us letterboxing addicts.  <br/>
<br/>
We're also pretty avid hikers and have hiked in several other parts <br/>
of the world. Therefore we have good boots, rain gear, etc.  However <br/>
we are DAY hikers, not backpackers and rarely campers. We generally <br/>
prefer to stay in a comfy lodge or hotel when evening rolls around.<br/>
<br/>
We generally can hike 10-15 miles per day, depending on terrain.  We <br/>
can hike more than that if it is flat, but flat is not what we are <br/>
usually looking for! <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the warning about the compass, never realized things may <br/>
be different.  I guess we may need to purchase a new one when we get <br/>
there. <br/>
<br/>
We will bring along at least 2 boxes to plant, and they will be <br/>
planted on one of our hikes.  We'll take your container advice into <br/>
consideration if we get ambitious and carve more.  Do you know what <br/>
the dimensions are?<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to our trip, and hopefully meeting some of you!<br/>
