Michael's "Murray's" box looks like a good one for me to try, <br/>

that would be a good one for a group outing?  Judi, let me know if <br/>
you'd like to join forces...<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1073514915">I don't think we'll manage to get out this weekend - Saturday we're off to<br/>
the Indian Festival in Kilbirnie (the Sri Lankan dosai are just fantastic!).<br/>
Sunday we'll be catching up on work missed on Saturday. Monday, if it's<br/>
fine, we'll try and get out boxing. We have funny working hours b/c our<br/>
clients are in the USA so we end up working in Eastern Standard Time as much<br/>
as possible - which also means Monday is our Sunday!<br/>
<br/>
Let us know when you find Michael's box - we want you to be first finder so<br/>
are holding off finding it till you do!<br/>
<br/>
My big news is that I've finally broken my carving drought. We went to the<br/>
Karori Wildlife Sanctuary art day last weekend and I did some sketches that<br/>
I couldn't resist turning into a stamp. I tried out some carving tools a<br/>
friend made me and finally got the hang of them. I was able to get really<br/>
fine detail much more easily. The tools are made from cannula needles - the<br/>
sort used for body piercing (eeeeouch!).<br/>
<br/>
By the way, I wouldn't dream of putting a box in the Karori Sanctuary, but I<br/>
might see if I can find a spot outside the perimeter somewhere. I'm not just<br/>
concerned for the precious, rare wildlife there, but also b/c of the number<br/>
of poison bait stations. That's an issue in a number of spots where we might<br/>
also letterbox - I have visions of little kids and dogs inadvertently<br/>
getting poisoned while trying to find a box. So it probably pays to scout<br/>
the area somewhat to make sure boxes are well away from bait stations. There<br/>
usually seems to be notices at the trail heads if there are stations in the<br/>
vicinity.<br/>
<br/>
As for spoilers - I'm looking forward to you paying penance :-))) A good<br/>
rule of thumb is to not disclose in a public forum any more details about<br/>
the box location than there are in the clues. If you get clues by<br/>
word-of-mouth rather than off the internet, then best to not mention them at<br/>
all on the talk lists. <br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
