                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1884439802">Good on you for also resolving to plant more! I must get my act together - I<br/>
have my February box ready to go, but just need to find the time and the<br/>
right spot to put it.<br/>
<br/>
Publicity is a double-edged sword. We've been involved in magazine and<br/>
newspaper articles before, and it was a newspaper article that got us into<br/>
letterboxing in the first place. But it would seem that everytime a<br/>
newspaper article goes out, more boxes go missing or are vandalized. I<br/>
believe word-of-mouth is a better method to get more people boxing,<br/>
especially because you can take the time to fully explain the idea and to<br/>
also take them boxing. But newspaper articles can be a good way to kick<br/>
start it in an area where not much is happening.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone does want to engage the media, do go ahead, and do feel free to<br/>
ask this mailing list for advice if you like. And do let us know when/where<br/>
the article will appear. Generally we want to push the idea that it's a<br/>
great activity for all the family, teaches lots of skills; also that the<br/>
"leave no trace" and respect for the environment message. Try not to mention<br/>
that some feel letterboxes could be confused with bombs - its such a red<br/>
herring (after all we don't see people get worried about litter when it too<br/>
could just as easily be a bomb!). <br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
