<br/>
Well it took me a week but I finally found my first NZ box..the <br/>
Goldmine Express.  It looks like it was vandalized as the tupperware <br/>
was about 100 yards from its hiding place my son and husband e <br/>
accidentally found it while I was looking for it, with its contents <br/>
strewn all over. Fortunaltely everyting seemed there and the logbook <br/>
was dry so we packied it all up and hid it were I thought it should <br/>
be.  <br/>
<br/>
Gald I checked my email because we willl be in Taupo soon and I wan tot <br/>
find that new box!<br/>
<br/>
Hope to plant some soon too!<br/>
