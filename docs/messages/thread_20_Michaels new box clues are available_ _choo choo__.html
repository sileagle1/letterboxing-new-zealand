Judi, let us know how you get on with the searching.  We're hoping to <br/>
go looking for some more of your Wellington boxes this weekend.  I've <br/>
also got enough stuff to go and place another box &lt;grin&gt;</div>

finding that is going on around NZ :-)<br/>
<br/>
We're waiting for the weather to clear a bit before doing Colonial Knob -<br/>
the spare moments we've had have not been conducive. Linton had fun decoding<br/>
your cryptic clues last night, but it may be a little longer before we go<br/>
hunting for that box - we haven't put our bikes together since we moved and<br/>
I'm not sure my butt is up to it yet :-D<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
