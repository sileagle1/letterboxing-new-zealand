Happy trails! Don't worry--the sun will come back! Us folks above the<br/>
equator just wanted to borrow it for a few months, but we'll give it<br/>
back. =)<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1510260369">Hi everyone!  I've been meaning to get on this site and post a message <br/>
for a while, but the busy river season prevented that!  Chaucey, <br/>
congratulations on your wedding, and I hope you had lots of fun boxing <br/>
in Europe!  How are you guys?  I hope this finds you well.  Reece and <br/>
I are glad that our summer is over, so now we can continue <br/>
letterboxing here, and relax a bit before the next season!  We had to <br/>
put everything on hold for the summer.  Very frustrating, but that's <br/>
ok!<br/>
Anyway, I just wanted to say hello to everyone!  Thanks again for such <br/>
a fun meeting and exchange when we were there.  We had a lot of fun in <br/>
NZ, and hope to visit again sometime soon!  Happy Hunting! : )</div>
