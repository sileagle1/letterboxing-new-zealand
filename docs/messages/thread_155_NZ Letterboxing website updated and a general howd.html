<p class="ygrps-yiv-1656204884MsoNormal">Howdy – welcome to our recent new subscribers and
hello to the rest of you. It’s been far too long but I finally got around
to updating my list of New Zealand letterboxes, broken down by region. There
has been a huge increase in boxes in the past six months. Of particular note
are the dedicated efforts of Petra (jp nature) from Turangi and 55 Steps from
Christchurch. </p>

<p class="ygrps-yiv-1656204884MsoNormal">In other news, I heard that there was an article about
letterboxing in NZ Wilderness magazine. Has anyone seen it? I couldn’t
find anything on their website. Also, I was contacted by Radio NZ National last
week. They’re looking for someone in the Wellington region who's a good
talker and who's knowledgeable and enthusiastic about letterboxing. That isn’t
me! (well the good talker bit anyway) so I passed along Chaucey’s
details, but if any other Wellingtonian is interested, please get in touch as I’m
not sure how active Chaucey is these days.</p>
<p class="ygrps-yiv-1656204884MsoNormal">  </p>
<p class="ygrps-yiv-1656204884MsoNormal">So while the weather might not be so conducive to boxing
this weekend, perhaps it’s a good opportunity to plan summer holidays, do
some carving, and cook up some clues. Has anyone had some recent letterboxing
adventures they’d like to share with the group? We’d love to hear
about them!</p>

<br/>
Thanks for the update.  I'll have to go and have a look at where all the new letterboxs are.<br/>
<br/>
Can you please mark Time to Travel placed by Kiwi Nomad as gone.  I thought I had let you know but must have forgotten, from memory it is marked as gone on the American letterboxing sites (as well as the geocaching site).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
Catherine<br/>
