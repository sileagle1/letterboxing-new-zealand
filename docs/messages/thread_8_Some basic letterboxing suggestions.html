<div><span class="ygrps-yiv-145494999621112307-10082004"><font color="#800080" face="Arial" size="2">We've 
thrilled to see a number of new letterboxers join the list recently, so I 
thought it might be a good time to make some general observations and 
suggestions about letterboxing. There is also a new letterboxing group 
especially for newbies - i<span class="ygrps-yiv-145494999204325707-10082004">t</span><span class="ygrps-yiv-145494999204325707-10082004"> has</span> an American focus, but may help answer 
some of your questions</font></span></div>
<div><span class="ygrps-yiv-145494999621112307-10082004"><font color="#800080" face="Arial" size="2"><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/newboxers/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/newboxers/</a>. 
<br/>As well as Linton and me here in NZ, there are also a number of other 
experienced boxers from overseas on this list that are happy to answer your 
questions.</font></span></div>
<div><span class="ygrps-yiv-145494999621112307-10082004"><font color="#800080" face="Arial" size="2"></font></span> </div>
<div><span class="ygrps-yiv-145494999621112307-10082004"><font color="#800080" face="Arial" size="2">The 
basics (which are mostly pretty obvious, but are worth saying just in 
case):</font></span></div>
<ul>
<li><span class="ygrps-yiv-145494999621112307-10082004"><font color="#800080" face="Arial" size="2">It's 
  important to be discreet so as to not draw attention to the box location. If 
  someone approachs you to ask what you're doing, it's usually easier to 
  say you're taking photos, sketching a flower, or eating lunch. We usually wait 
  until there is no-one about before approaching the box location - both when 
  finding and when rehiding. </font></span>
<li><span class="ygrps-yiv-145494999621112307-10082004"><font color="#800080" face="Arial" size="2">It 
  may help to take the box a little ways away from the hiding spot 
  to stamp in.</font></span>
<li><span class="ygrps-yiv-145494999621112307-10082004"><font color="#800080" face="Arial" size="2">Rehide the box well - better than you found it if possible (though 
  still in the same spot!). It's not a good idea to leave a little bit of the 
  box showing to help the next person. A well-hidden box should never be found 
  inadvertently.</font></span>
<li><span class="ygrps-yiv-145494999621112307-10082004"><font color="#800080" face="Arial" size="2">Make 
  sure all the plastic baggies are well sealed and that the log book particulary 
  is protected from water. We have found too many letterboxes that have been 
  trashed by the weather. We try to carry extra plastic bags just in case a box 
  we find needs running repairs.</font></span>
<li><span class="ygrps-yiv-145494999621112307-10082004"><font color="#800080" face="Arial" size="2">If 
  you're planting a box, avoid sensitive areas (delicate plants, rare birds, 
  sacred grounds, historic ruins).</font></span>
<li><span class="ygrps-yiv-145494999621112307-10082004"><font color="#800080" face="Arial" size="2">It's 
  OK to talk about specific letterboxes on the talk lists in very general terms 
  (ie you found it, it needs repair, etc), but avoid giving away the location, 
  or the answers to a mystery or cryptic clue, or any other surprises that there 
  might be. If you're not sure about something it is best to email the box 
  owner/maintainer first.</font></span>
<li><span class="ygrps-yiv-145494999621112307-10082004"><font color="#800080" face="Arial" size="2">Be 
  careful to not put yourself or others in a dangerous situation by ignoring 
  fatigue, changing weather, etc., on the quest for a box. It is all to 
  easy to get obsessed with the chase!</font></span>
<li><span class="ygrps-yiv-145494999621112307-10082004"><font color="#800080" face="Arial" size="2">Be 
  warned - letterboxing is addictive! But good for you too (how often does that 
  happen these days!!??)</font></span></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></ul>
<div><span class="ygrps-yiv-145494999621112307-10082004"><font color="#800080" face="Arial" size="2">If 
you've been looking round some of the letterboxing sites and groups, you may 
wonder what P, F, and X counts are. P is for the number of boxes Placed, F for 
the number Found, and X for the number eXchanged with other boxers.<span class="ygrps-yiv-145494999204325707-10082004"><font color="#008080"> </font></span>One dude in 
Dartmoor, England has found over 50000 letterboxes (that's not a typo).

people keep these statistics, letterboxing isn't a 
competition.</font></font></span></font></span></div>

some of this is helpful. Feel free to email me with any questions if you don't 
want to ask the entire group.</font></span></div>
