Michael and I hid a letterbox today - clues to follow hopefully soon!<br/>
<br/>
Haven't done much other letterboxing, although we managed to find 4 <br/>
geocaches, and have "did not find" on 3 others.<br/>
<br/>
What about everyone else?  <br/>

Judi - the route listings are cool :-)  Rebecca and Derek - I can't <br/>

helping paint the in-law's house so can't even take advantage of the summery<br/>
weather we're getting at long last. We did, however, get a letterbox clue<br/>
for a Christmas present from Linton's Mum, so will post the clues once we've<br/>
solved them.<br/>
<br/>
An American couple have also just reported in on their trip to NZ - they<br/>
found a lot of boxes and have planted one (clues coming soon). They also<br/>
reported that the 8km Laurel Quest box had to be moved because the tree it<br/>
was planted under has been cut down and it looked like culprits might be<br/>
coming back for the stumps. I will post amended clues soon.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
