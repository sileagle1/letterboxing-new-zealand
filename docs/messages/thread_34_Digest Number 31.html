<br/>
My messages don't seem to go through when I post to the group via the group <br/>
page, so I thought I'd try posting via email instead.<br/>
<br/>
I'm from Christchurch &amp; have just started letterboxing as of Sunday. A <br/>
random link I stumbled upon introduced me to the concept (I already knew <br/>
about geocaching but had never heard of letterboxing) &amp; my daughter &amp; I went <br/>
to hunt for the Native YEP letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Much to our surprise, it was still there 3 years after the last person had <br/>
visited it! We cleaned it up a bit, double bagged the journal (a little bit <br/>
of water had seeped into the container) &amp; rehid it.<br/>
<br/>
Now we're looking to place a few of our own round the area as there aren't <br/>
many in or near Christchurch. I guess the alternative is to carefully choose <br/>
our next holiday destination based on a few letterbox clues :)<br/>
<br/>
Keep smiling,<br/>
Amy<br/>
