for the brain and the body).<br/>
<br/>
Glad to see someone is trying to find our dear dolphin - there has been a<br/>
close attempt, but no success yet as far as I know.<br/>
<br/>
What part of NZ are you in?<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>

P.S. And just a friendly reminder to everyone to watch what they say here<br/>
about mystery letterboxes - we don't want to give away too many secrets :-))<br/>
