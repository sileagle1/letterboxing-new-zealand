If you box in Colorado don't spoil the excitement and look at it!<br/>

By the way, Esmerelda sent me a letterbox which arrived today - I am in AWE<br/>
of her craft skills.  Excellant carving and wonderful hand work on<br/>
everything else!  I can't wait to get it out there and let people find it.<br/>

<br/>
&gt; &gt; Still, Esmerelda from Colorado said the detail in my (eraser)<br/>
&gt; &gt; carving was good. So perhaps I don't need to change... (she<br/>
&gt; &gt; received my stamp &amp; log-book this week).  I wish I could send<br/>
&gt; &gt; you all a picture, but if someone from Colorado read this<br/>
&gt; &gt; message then it might give away the suprise....what do you think?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You could put the picture on your website and let us know the address -<br/>
then<br/>
&gt; if any Coloradians stumbled by they wouldn't have to click on it. I'd love<br/>
&gt; to see how you carving is progressing!<br/>

my desk, I know how tiny it is.. about 1" by 1".  Which just amazes <br/>
me that you could get those tiny details in there!!  My carving <br/>
skills are no way better than your's...you'll see that it's a lot <br/>
easier to carve details, etc., when you're carving in a big old hunk <br/>
of the good stuff!  I do have a number 1 nib that I heated up and <br/>
squished to make a fine detail nib... works great.  <br/>
<br/>
I'm probably going to plant your little kiwi somewhere around Cherry <br/>
Creek Reservoir in Denver.  It's a big park area with lots of trees <br/>
and trails and good spots.. but also fairly close to everyone and <br/>
easy to get to.  Woohoo!  There are some letterboxers champing at <br/>
the bit to find him!<br/>
