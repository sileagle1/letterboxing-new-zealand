<br/>
Hope everyone had a fantastic Christmas!<br/>
<br/>
Well, it's been very busy here - Simon &amp; I got engaged a month ago &amp;<br/>
we're getting married next week. And we're moving to Melbourne at the<br/>
end of Jan. Plus there's been a million &amp; one other things happening.<br/>
So, as you can imagine, there hasn't been much letterboxing going on<br/>
of late!<br/>
<br/>
But, needless to say, the two boxes Isabella sent me have been<br/>
carefully placed in Christchurch (so now that's three within the<br/>
city!) and I'm assuming she will send the clues to Judi to put up on<br/>
the site.<br/>
<br/>
Hope everyone is well &amp; looking forward to a wonderful 2005 :)<br/>

I'm assuming she will put them on Atlas Quest herself under her<br/>

she probably hasn't seen her email yet.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, I am a little behind the news here (there is so much to catch up <br/>
&gt; on!), but I would like to add my congratulations to that of Judi and <br/>
&gt; Chaucey.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We really are a group for it - Derek and I are getting married in <br/>
&gt; November (this year, argh!) and I know Chaucey and Michael are also <br/>
&gt; getting married this year.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; All the best for Melbourne Amy.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Rebecca<br/>
