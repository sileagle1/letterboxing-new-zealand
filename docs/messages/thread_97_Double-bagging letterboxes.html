All - there's been a lot of talk over on AtlasQuest and on the "big list" about 
double-bagging letterboxes, and the general consensus is that if you're using a 
good quality box, then it does not need to be bagged on the outside. However, 
the recommended course of action is to double-bag the contents in the inside of 
the box.</font></span></div>

guilty of also bagging the outside of the box, assuming that it helps protect 
against a poorly sealed box. I'm also guilty of recommending to others 
that they do this too. But after reading the comments others have made, I 
agree that it is a bad idea - the bags tend to rip easily and they also 
take on water and then hold it against the box. People have also suggested that 
it makes the box look more like trash and that it can make it to easy to spot 
because the plastic is shiny. The key is to double-bag the contents in the 
inside instead.</font></span></div>

any of you noticed more problems with boxes that are bagged on the outside? 
I think we're particularly lucky here b/c the sistema snaplock boxes have a 
plastic o-ring that should help keep them extra water tight - they seem to be 
better than the rubbermaid and tupperware ones used in the States. On sale at 
Spotlight too :-))</font></span></div>

<br/>
</span></blockquote>But you know, even a poorly sealed box will still protect the contents<br/>
from sticks and rodents.  The baggies are only useful for keeping out<br/>
water and can do that from the inside of the box even better than from<br/>
the outside of the box. Thus, it can still help protect against a<br/>
poorly sealed box.  ;ol<br/>
<br/>
But then, those baggies don't always do a good job of keeping out<br/>
water either.  *shrug*  Pretty useless things when you think about it. ;o)<br/>
<br/>
Or, at least if you put a plastic bag around the letterbox to protect<br/>
against a poorly sealed box, you should also put another bag around<br/>
the first bag to protect against a poorly sealed bag.  And another bag<br/>
around that one to protect against that second bag being poorly sealed....<br/>
<br/>
Oh, nevermind.  I'm going for a walk to ponder the meaning of life.  =)<br/>
<br/>
Happy trails!  Wait a minute, that IS the meaning of life!  Happy<br/>
trails!  *thunking forehead*  Well, in that case, I'm just going to<br/>
walk to enjoy the sunshine.  =)<br/>
