Gosh, we do all get about don't we?  Psychokiwis having been down to Stewart<br/>
Island too.<br/>

My trip up to plant Esmereldas box went well today.  Clues should be up in<br/>
the next few days.  Sadly it wasn't really a holiday though - more of a<br/>
focussed mission!<br/>

down and find our boxes someday! They managed to go to Stewart Island for<br/>
the only week in a long long time when it hadn't been raining! The photos<br/>
they took are stunning.<br/>
