forum.  I'm doing both hobbies and having a great time.<br/>
<br/>
For example, yesterday Michael and I went and hid another letterbox ("the<br/>
little choo choo that could", clues to follow later today or perhaps<br/>
tommorow) and then we went and hunted for a geocache in the area before<br/>
going home.  I might even publish the co-ordinates of the letterbox - not<br/>
sure about going as far as logging it as a hybrid on the geocaching.com<br/>
website.  I will have to investigate further as I know there are rules..<br/>
<br/>
Now we are plotting our next spot to hide a letterbox.  I have lots of<br/>
ideas. I bought a stack of wellington guidebooks and mapbooks at the recent<br/>
book fair and they have heaps of walks and parks listed.<br/>
<br/>
Judi, I see that you are hoping Santa brings you a gps, get him to try<br/>
trademe, or the place I used was Downunder pilot shop (web-based), to get a<br/>
new garmin etrex for $257 all inclusive.<br/>
<br/>
Letterboxes, found 2, placed 2<br/>
Geocaches, found 4<br/>
and even got 3 points on the Geodashing game :-)<br/>

Chaucey and I have been talking to some of the NZ geo-cachers over on the<br/>
fora at www.gps.org.nz. They're a friendly bunch and are interested in doing<br/>
more hybrid letterbox/geo-caches. There are apparently 3 hybrids already in<br/>
the South Island. I'm also amazed at the number of different pasttimes there<br/>
are involving a GPS...<br/>
