<br/>
Almost exactly 2 years ago we spent 3 weeks vacationing in New Zealand.  While we were there we planted 2 boxes on the South Island and 3 on the North Island.  All had a Maori theme. The NI boxes were found after 1 year and now the SI boxes have been found after 2 years.  It was nice to hear that they are still in good shape.  I think each box has only had one visitor - 55 Steps for 4 of the boxes and Norfolk Nomads (from USA) for 1 box.<br/>
