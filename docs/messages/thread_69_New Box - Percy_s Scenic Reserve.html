We've planted a new box.  It is in Lower Hutt at Percy's Scenic <br/>
Reserve.<br/>
We went out there on the 28th and I really enjoyed it.  It was my <br/>
first time there, but Michael had been there many times as a child.<br/>
<br/>
Please bring your own ink pad for it.  Reccommended colours are blue <br/>
or brown.<br/>
<br/>
Clues are available via Atlasquest.</div>
