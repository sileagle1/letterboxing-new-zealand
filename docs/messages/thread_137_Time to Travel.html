Geocache.com and will set it up on a/the letterboxing site as well.<br/>
Sorry guys its in Ashburton so a bit of a drive to get.<br/>
Am just slightly excited about it, ok totaly buzzing.  Can't wait to <br/>
see who is the first to find.<br/>
<br/>
Almost found Native YEP on Saturday, got all the way to Riccaton Bush <br/>
looked at the map and realised we didn't have time to complete so will <br/>
have to go back another day.</div>

am planning on placing another one near by in the next month or two so <br/>
unless you are close enough to make two trips will probably be worth <br/>
waiting untill that is up and running.<br/>
Past placing a second one and trying to finaly get to Native YEP I have <br/>
no other plans at this stage.</div>
