up.  =)  <br/>
<br/>
About that whole mounting-stamps thread--very few stamps I think<br/>
really need a mount on them.  Sometimes it's nice, but unless the<br/>
stamp is REALLY thin, almost never necessary.  Even the thin<br/>
Mastercarve (1/4 inch, I think?) holds up pretty well without a mount.<br/>
<br/>
You can see how I've mounted a few stamps in the carving tutorial on<br/>
Atlas Quest.  In fact, the only stamps I've mounted I did so just to<br/>
make that tutorial!  Just because I generally don't mount stamps<br/>
doesn't mean others won't want to!  =)  Also has some stamp carving<br/>
suggestions for those who are still new to the sport of carving<br/>
stamps, though I'm not sure how many of you have access to those nibs<br/>
that I think are so wonderful.  =)<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and I'm sorry about all the snowmen and stuff on Atlas Quest.  =)<br/>
 It IS getting to be winter here in the northern hemisphere where most<br/>
users are located!  I haven't figured out how to determine what<br/>
hemisphere someone is located in to display seasonally appropriate<br/>
themes.  Well, I suppose I could ask users to include their hemisphere<br/>
of choice, but that seems kind of like overkill....<br/>
<br/>
In other news....  Who's getting excited about the total solar eclipse<br/>
hitting your part of the world next April?!  It looks like the<br/>
totality portion JUST misses New Zealand from the map I'm looking at (<br/>
<a href="http://sunearth.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse/OH/image1/Fig01-HSE2005.GIF" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://sunearth.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse/OH/image1/Fig01-HSE2005.GIF</a> ),<br/>
but I should think they'll be plenty of boats or planes heading out to<br/>
the area of totality to nab a good seat. =)<br/>
<br/>
Amanda and I want to fly to Panama and see totality towards the end of<br/>
the eclipse.  And hey, it's Panama!  Should be an adventure.  =)  It's<br/>
also the closest and most accessible place to be on the totality path<br/>
from the United STates.<br/>
<br/>
This eclipse is also an annular eclipse, which I've never seen before.<br/>
 (For those that don't know what that means, I'll explain: When the<br/>
moon is smaller than the sun, it can't *quite* cover the entire<br/>
surface of the sun--unlike most total solar eclipses that you always<br/>
see pictures of and are important in movies.  In an annular<br/>
eclipse--even though it IS total--some of the sun still peaks around<br/>
the edges of the moon.)  Anyhow, from what I understand, annular<br/>
eclipses aren't near as spectacular as non-annular ones, but still! <br/>
It's pretty darned close and should be quite a show!<br/>
<br/>
So....  Am I the only one here planning ahead for this?  =)<br/>
<br/>
Happy trails!<br/>

I hadn't heard about the eclipse.  Now that you've told me about it I <br/>

I like the Northern Hemisphere decorations on Atlasquest.  It is <br/>
totally not a problem. It's a nice change from the stuff we see in <br/>
the shops here.  We had some very un-summery weather last night <br/>
though, it was so windy and rainy last night that my flight from <br/>
Wellington to Auckland was cancelled.  <br/>
<br/>

But you know, you just aren't a REAL letterboxer if you don't have ink<br/>
the fingers.  ;o)<br/>

it'll follow is at<br/>

</span></blockquote>Well, you know....  *blatent plug alert*  I've created a number of<br/>
non-letterboxing message boards on Atlas Quest for aspiring writers,<br/>
voricious readers, music, backpacking, foods and recipes, and, yes,<br/>
astronomy!  =)  And if there's a subject you really want to talk about<br/>
that isn't represented, let me know and I'll be happy to add it! <br/>
(Well, I'll PROBABLY be happy to add it--as long as it's not porn,<br/>
illegal, etc, etc.  The usual stuff!)<br/>
