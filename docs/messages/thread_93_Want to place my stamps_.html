I've just been glancing over some messages on the board here and <br/>
noticed that a few people are willing to place stamps that others <br/>
carve.  I was in NZ last December with carving materials but only <br/>
placed one box on the North Island - Kiwi Crossing - yet had hoped <br/>
to place several, especially on the South Island.  I have one stamp <br/>
that I'd carved while there but never placed and had several drawn <br/>
out.  I've already begun saving for my next trip out your way, but <br/>
it'll be at least 2 years most likely. In the meantime, if anyone <br/>
would like to plant my volcano stamp or my tramping stamp, let me <br/>
know and I'll mail them along with log books.  I had also wanted to <br/>
make up a "Shire" stamp for Matamata, so if you'll be out that way, <br/>
let me know. By the way, you don't need to send me a stamp unless <br/>
you'd like to.  I'd be happy to reciprocate if you'd like.<br/>
Oh, and while you're LBing, keep an eye out for Maneki Neko, the <br/>
good fortune cat.<br/>
BTW, NZ is incredible!<br/>

I'd be happy to place some boxes for you. I'm from Matamata orginally (no I<br/>
don't have hairy feet!) and do go through every now and then, so can place a<br/>
Shire box for you. We drive the Desert Road near the volcanoes on the<br/>
central plateau 2-3 times a year, so could place a volcano stamp too. We<br/>
also plan to go down south sometime this year. I could also pass along any<br/>
other stamps to other NZ boxers to place so that I don't hog them all :-))))<br/>
<br/>
Let me know if that sounds good to you and I'll email you my postal address.<br/>
<br/>
Kind regards,<br/>
<br/>
Judi<br/>

That sounds absolutely perfect!  Thanks so much.  I'll get started <br/>
making some log books.  I fell in love with the ones you made and <br/>
have decided to do likewise - such a nice touch :-)<br/>
