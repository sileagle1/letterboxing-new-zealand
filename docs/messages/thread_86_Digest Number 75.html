<br/>
I think there were maybe 2 people stamped in before me but they were not <br/>
long after you'd placed the box. And they were tourists. But there seem to <br/>
be more people in NZ getting into letterboxing, so hopefully more people <br/>
will have a look for it.<br/>
<br/>
I loved your stamp, though! Very nice :)<br/>
<br/>
I lived in Christchurch but now (as of a couple of weeks ago) I'm living in <br/>
Australia. NZ is definately prettier.<br/>

&gt;Thanks for the report, Amy, and for your help to restore the box<br/>
&gt;contents!  We are glad you enjoyed finding the box.  :o)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Do you remember how many folks had stamped in since it was placed?<br/>
&gt;We are just curious.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;You are correct, the email included in the box is no longer valid.<br/>
&gt;Since then I learned to include a hotmail email, which will most<br/>
&gt;likely never change.  I guess that's how we learn, though.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Were you visiting New Zealand or did you live there?  We thoroughly<br/>
&gt;enjoyed our visit there as the country and people are truly<br/>
&gt;marvelous and and friendly too.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks again for your help.<br/>

<br/>
Actually, the "tourists" I believe were John and Amanda, both from <br/>
Oregon too.  We are all in the same letterboxing group and since <br/>
they were going to go to New Zealand a few months after us, had <br/>
encouraged us to place a box for them to find.  For all we know, it <br/>
could have been the first LB placed in NZ, or perhaps on the South <br/>
Island, but I don't know that for sure.<br/>
<br/>
At any rate we are glad you had fun finding the box and enjoyed the <br/>
stamp too.  :o)<br/>
<br/>
We are glad to hear it is still there and now a bit dryer thanks to <br/>
your loving care.<br/>
<br/>
Mark<br/>
