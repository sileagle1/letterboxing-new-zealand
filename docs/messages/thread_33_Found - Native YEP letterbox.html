<br/>
My daughter &amp; I went out today to have a hunt for the Native YEP<br/>
letterbox...&amp; were thrilled to find it safe &amp; sound 3 years after the<br/>
last person had visited it!<br/>
<br/>
The container had got a little bit of water in it, so we cleaned it<br/>
out &amp; dryed the bags...&amp; double bagged the notebook so it didn't get<br/>
wet or damaged by a bulldog clip that had started to rust.<br/>
<br/>
It's spurred us on to create a decent homemade stamp...so we stopped<br/>
off at Witcoulls to pick up some large erasers.<br/>
<br/>
So I think I'm hooked! Only, there aren't any other letterboxes close<br/>
enough to Chch to go out for the day looking for them. I think I shall<br/>
have to place some of my own...<br/>
