of fun!  We've been traveling around the South Island for the past <br/>
week, and are heading back up to the North Island next week.  We will <br/>
be in Wellington the evening of the 22nd.  We would love to meet with <br/>
anyone who's interested.  We have 3 boxes to trade!  Sorry about the <br/>
short notice. . .we haven't been near too many computers.  (Too much <br/>
of enjoying your beautiful country!)  We're sad that we will only be <br/>
in Wellington that night.  We leave on the train the next morning.  <br/>
If it's possible to meet with anyone the evening of the 22nd, we <br/>
would love it!  Just let us know where/when!  (We won't have <br/>
transportation, and don't know our way around, so the chances of us <br/>
finding you might be slim!) We're excited to meet some of you!  We'll <br/>
see you later!! (Hopefully!)<br/>

help. Are you getting to Wellington by ferry or by plane and what time are<br/>
you getting in? Where are you staying? Once we have some idea what you're up<br/>
to, we can suggest a good spot to meet up. I'm not sure if I'll have a box<br/>
to trade (not that organized) but I have a special box to share plus a<br/>
traveller too (if you can find the magic password!)<br/>
<br/>
Chaucey &amp; Michael and you other elusive Wellington boxers - are you free<br/>
that evening? Would be fun to have a mini-gather.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
