                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1964263393">Hello.  Im Kiwiboots Located in Dargaville Northland NZ. I am new to letterboxing.  Over the next few weeks I will place my first letterbox in my area.  I have been to a few of the letterbox locations on Atlasquest before whilst on holiday, not knowing about letterboxing, I was unaware to look for the letterbox's.  Im wandering what to add to my letterbox,  Im am planning to use a small 400ml Systema box, has a rubber sealing lid around the rim.  Easily available at my local- The Wharhouse.  I use these in my pantry.  I will try and cover with some cammo school  book covering or similar for some cammoflage.  Ok box is quite small so I will be adding a small notebook, stamp and a peice of pencill and sharpner.  Box is to small for a pen to be added. Don't want to use a to larger box for carrying in my tramping pack for placing during my summer trips.  What else should I add to the letterbox? I will record boxes GPS location for easier location if box is unable to be found easily from my clue directions. I will try to keep using the same typ of letterbox throughout my placement for easy identification.  <br/>
Do you have any suggestion to add to my small Box?  <br/>
I will place a small blurb to the finder about what the letterbox is, taped inside the lid encase a non letterboxer finds my box, asking person not to destroy my box and replace as found. <br/>
Any other sugestions?<br/>
I hope I can find one of your letterbox's one day soon!<br/>
Cheers Kiwiboots. Heather</div>

with your letterbox. I use the Systema containers too – they seem nicely
waterproof. I tend to use the smallest ones (200ml??) as they’re easier

the contents in the ziplock bags, and the bags into the container. (Don’t
put the container into a bag as we’ve found they tend to tear and let in
water over time). </span></p>
