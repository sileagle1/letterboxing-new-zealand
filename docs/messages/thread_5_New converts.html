a couple more boxes in the meantime, before we'll be out there <br/>
planting our own.  No promises on quality of the carving (!), but <br/>
that definitely is a promise to start hiding boxes...<br/>
<br/>
Any hints and tips etc on stamp carving, and what materials / tools <br/>

See you (or your boxes) around!<br/>

<br/>
Don't worry about how good your carving is or isn't - it's just a matter of<br/>
doing it - you'll be surprised what you can do after a little practice and<br/>
experimentation. (yeah I need to listen to my own advice - I haven't carved<br/>
for ages and am scared to get back into it...). <br/>
<br/>
There are lots of techniques to try out and there are some very good<br/>
tutorials on the web (e.g., <a href="http://atlasquest.com/tutorials/carving/)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://atlasquest.com/tutorials/carving/)</a><br/>
I started off with an old Mars eraser and a small box-cutter and got<br/>
reasonable results. I now use a gouging blade (that linoleum carvers use)<br/>
and am experimenting with cannula needles (that are used for body-piercing!)<br/>
to get fine detail. I'm not sure what supplies are available in NZ - Linton<br/>
and I worked for 4 years in the USA (where we got the letterboxing bug) and<br/>
came back to NZ only last October so we're still scoping things out. I've<br/>
noticed that stamp pads and erasers are very expensive here - I brought back<br/>
a stash thank goodness. There is a Stamp/Scrapbooking shop in Wellington<br/>
which may have some other carving supplies - I'll check them out sometime.<br/>
Otherwise I'm tempted to order supplies through the internet when I run out.<br/>
<br/>
Some various thoughts on making up letterboxes... I've put a stamp pad in<br/>
most boxes I've placed, but I'm thinking I might not do that in future. In<br/>
the states there are regional differences as to whether stamp pads are<br/>
included or not - generally weather dictated. In Dartmoor (the home of<br/>
letterboxing in the UK) there is a big problem of the stamp pads being<br/>
stolen. Here I'm inclined not to because of the expense and also because the<br/>
best containers I've found so far are those 200ml "sistema" clear containers<br/>
(with blue click-clack locks) from the supermarket - they are a bit small to<br/>
put a logbook, stamp, and stamp pad in comfortably. In the USA, many boxes<br/>
use spiral-bound notecards for the log book. I haven't seen similar here.<br/>
I've found small artist's books that would suit a larger container (but the<br/>
smaller the better). Unlined books are nicer b/c the stamp images come out<br/>
more clearly, but most little books I've found are lined. I make my own<br/>
logbooks, mainly b/c I like making them. I can then size them to the<br/>
container. Some "micro-boxes" just use a film cannister and a long skinny<br/>
roll of paper. Water-proofing is a big deal and it's a good idea to<br/>
double-bag the logbook (using ziplock plastic bags) and then even put the<br/>
container in another bag.<br/>
<br/>
Hope some of this burble helps. We're happy to help and are delighted at the<br/>
prospect of new boxes to find :-))<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>

&gt; carving!  <br/>
<br/>
</span></blockquote>Don't feel too bad if your first carving looks terrible.  Very few <br/>
people can carve well their first time out!  Once you try it a few <br/>
times, however, you'll be surprised at how well you can carve.  It <br/>
generally doesn't take long before people are carving stamps they <br/>
feel are 'acceptable'.  And with a bit more practice, you'll be <br/>
ooohh-ing and ahhh-ing your stamps in wonder!  =)  Really!  <br/>
<br/>
Getting supplies might be difficult, though.  I kept my eyes open <br/>
for carving and stamp supplies while traveling around Central <br/>
America and couldn't find anything that was even remotely useful <br/>
except for containers.  And because people there are SOO poor, I was <br/>
afraid if I used one of those containers for a box (they didn't have <br/>
the cheap, plastic containers frequently used in the United States--<br/>
they don't have the 'luxury' of having disposable items like that), <br/>
if any of the locals found it, they'd take it home with them to <br/>
actually use for food!  (The gall! *smile*)<br/>
<br/>
I've never been to New Zealand before, but from what I've heard, <br/>
poverty isn't quite the problem there as in Central America, so the <br/>
theft of Rubbermaid containers for use or sale probably isn't as <br/>
much of a concern.  But I can see where getting carving supplies <br/>
might be difficult.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe Judy--if you're up for it--can buy in bulk from the Internet <br/>
at times and be the 'local supply' for carving and stamping supplies <br/>
if nothing good is found.  I'm not sure how practical that would be, <br/>
but it's a thought I'd throw out there.  =)<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!  =)<br/>

just as good, if not better. They actually have a rubber ring within the<br/>
lid, which should make the container more waterproof (but time will tell).<br/>
They're also smaller and so easier to hide. I bought one the other day for<br/>
NZ$2 (US$1.30) - the Rubbermaid ones used to cost me just under US$3. So NZ<br/>
wins on the container front :-)<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure gouge blades are around  - we have some lovely art supply stores. I<br/>
did find a complete carving set in one store, but I can't remember how much<br/>
it was. I haven't seen the large blocks of carving material though. Mars<br/>
erasers are expensive, but I did find some cheaper vinyl erasers that I<br/>
haven't tried to carve yet. I'm guessing they may be more crumbly.<br/>
<br/>
Another option may be the Dartmoor way, where a hand-drawn image is taken to<br/>
a rubber-stamp maker and it is professionally made. There is such a store in<br/>
Wellington, but I have not investigated yet (mainly b/c I prefer carving the<br/>
images myself).<br/>

It's hard to know what is an equivalent to a brand that isn't <br/>
available here...<br/>
<br/>
We found a lino carving set in Whitcoulls for under $15 with 5 <br/>
different blades that could be fitted to the one handle, so we'll see <br/>
how we go with that.  But stamp pads, well pretty boring choice of <br/>
colours available!  I'm hoping a specialist art store might have some <br/>
better options...<br/>
<br/>
Most of the 'erasers' we can find are the vinyl variety not rubber, <br/>
which is not so good, but I suppose not bad for practising technique <br/>
on.<br/>
<br/>
As we find out what is available here we'll share it so that any <br/>
other Kiwis interested in getting started can know where to go for <br/>
supplies.</div>

Staedler Mars erasers are probably the best - use fingernail polish remover<br/>
to get rid of the writing on it. Glad you found a carving set so easily.<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-2028851234">Yes this is a "done" thing. Its also a good way to populate an area with<br/>
boxes made by different people so that they don't all have the same look to<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
Did you see the "About Letterboxing" phamplet in the files section? You<br/>
might want to consider including a couple of them in the boxes you plant (or<br/>
something similar).<br/>
