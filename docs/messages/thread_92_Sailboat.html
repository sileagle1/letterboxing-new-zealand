they could find it for themselves.  I noticed a few updates to the <br/>
clues since they were written.  Does anyone know how to get hold of <br/>
Letterbox Ninja?<br/>
<br/>
Also, the box could use a new plastic bag to protect it if you are <br/>
planning to visit - it would fit inside the larger sized ziplock bags <br/>
that you can sometimes get at the supermarket to put bulk foods in.<br/>
