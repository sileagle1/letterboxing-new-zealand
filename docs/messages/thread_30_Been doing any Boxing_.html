                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1505789696">I did some boxing last weekend.  Found "A bird in the hand is worth <br/>
two in the bush" (beautiful stamps) and placed one, "Karori Capers".  <br/>
I had to ford a wee stream to place my box and Michael chickened out <br/>
(he was wearing nice shoes he didn't want to wreck) from coming with <br/>
me.<br/>
<br/>
I also splashed out a bought a kit from the scrapbook store to do <br/>
things like set eyelets.  I have visions of making lots of small <br/>
logbooks with eyelets as part of the binding.  It's really getting me <br/>
to think more "craftily".<br/>
<br/>
This weekend I am going to walk a beginners orienteering course that <br/>
the Hutt Valley Orienteering Club are setting.  I don't have the <br/>
fitness or bravery to get really involved in that currently though.<br/>
<br/>
Next weekend on the 16th I am going to be manning a tent at the <br/>
Highland gathering at Harcourt Park.  I'm looking forward to that.  <br/>
Perhaps I'll get time to hide a box too!<br/>
