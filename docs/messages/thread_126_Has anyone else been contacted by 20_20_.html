info about letterboxing. I've replied saying I'm available by email only (Team 
Psychokiwi is media shy!), but if any of you are interested in 15 minutes of 
fame, please let me know and I'll pass along your contact

attention about letterboxing is always a double-edged sword. The rate of boxes 
going missing and being vandalized tend to increase just after a newspaper 
article, etc. However, especially in an area that is just starting out in 
letterboxing, media attention can get enough people interested to form a 
critical mass. </font></span></div>

you're worried about particular boxes (ones you've laboured over getting just 
right), I'd suggest not making the clues public. Instead make the clues 
"word-of-mouth", passing clue sheets around privately to those you 
know are genuine boxers. We've only done a few like that, but then many of ours 
are mystery boxes so only the motivated actually bother trying to solve 
them.</font></span></div>

<br/>
I've been a bit incapacitated recently, I'm pregnant and not feeling <br/>
100%. So no letterboxing action has been going on at my house, unless <br/>
you count dreams about letterboxing!  I've tried to content myself with <br/>
a bit of virtual boxing via atlasquest, but it isn't the same and I've <br/>
also noticed that the quality of those hunts are going down, some don't <br/>
even have rubber stamp images.<br/>
<br/>
Judi, I think 20/20 must have just contacted you, you are the most <br/>
prolific boxer in NZ after all! Maybe they got the idea because of the <br/>
story about geocaching on Closeup.<br/>
<br/>
I hope everyone is feeling okay during this supercold winter and that <br/>
all the boxes out there are staying in good condition.<br/>
<br/>
Regards,<br/>

not feel like it is if you are getting the unpleasant side effects!)  <br/>
When are you due?<br/>
<br/>
We have also been super slack on the box placing front despite good <br/>
resolutions.  The cold weather is very off putting!  And we have just <br/>
moved house so it is not top priority.  In fact, I don't know quite <br/>
where our letterboxing gear is at the moment... but I do remember <br/>
packing it all up together!<br/>
<br/>
I hope everyone is well.<br/>
