Have you got any you are planning on finding or have you got some ready <br/>
to put out?<br/>
We have hired a camper van and going up to Springs Junction for a<br/>
geocaching event. On the way I want to find two caches and two<br/>
letterboxes in Rication Bush (sp).<br/>
Have got a container for the one I want to put out and got a three pack<br/>
of erasers today from The Warehouse. Hope I got the right type. Even <br/>
have an idea for my stamp. Now just have to get the idea from my head <br/>
and carved on to the stamp.<br/>
I would love to hear what you all are getting up to.</div>
