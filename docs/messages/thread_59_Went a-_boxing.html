We finally got out and about today to do some boxing and added <font size="2">"Murray's Last Minute Winner" to our collection. The box was partially 
exposed but in good condition. There was an entry from a non-letterboxer who had 
stumbled across it and was quite intrigued by it. We found a nice big rock and 
rehid the box in the same spot but with better coverage so hopefully it will not 
be found inadvertently again - too often they just get vandalized when found by 
non-boxers :-(</font></font></span></div>

That is really odd about someone having randomly found it.  I wonder <br/>
how?  It seemed to be tucked away quite safely to me when I found and <br/>
replaced it.  Perhaps they had a dog and hecould smell my scent <br/>
strongly on the plastic bag and got curious...????  Oh well - perhaps <br/>
they will be a letterboxing convert!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for looking after it so well. Michael carved the stamp and <br/>
he'd hate to lose it because he isn't very confident with the carving.<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-2025081503">When we found it, it was covered only by a few leaves and twigs (which may<br/>
have covered it initially, but wind or rain may have moved them). It's going<br/>
to take a mighty fine breeze to move the rock which now covers it :-D<br/>
It wouldn't surprise me if a dog snuffled it out. At least we don't have<br/>
racoons here - one of my boxes in Connecticut keeps being eaten by one! <br/>
<br/>
I thought Michael's stamp was lovely - and very appropriate!<br/>
