                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1496216751">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I read about Letterboxing in a magazine article about a year ago.  I <br/>
thought it had interesting commercial possibilites for some form of <br/>
Corporate learning game which involved outdoor activities so I <br/>
obtained the domain names www.letterboxing.co.nz and <br/>
www.letterboxing.org.nz.  <br/>
<br/>
I also have an interest in adventure activities and at that time my <br/>
website www.adventurenz.co.nz was up and running but was not <br/>
attracting traffic.<br/>
<br/>
I am planning to redesign the adventurenz website initially with a <br/>
focus on building a community of people interested in adventure in <br/>
New Zealand.  I plan to incorporate letterboxing as an activity with <br/>
a link to a separate letterboxing website.<br/>
<br/>
One thought I have is that letterboxing.co.nz could be used for a <br/>
commercial venture providing letterboxing activities targeted at <br/>
corporates and the letterboxing.org.nz site would be non-profit and <br/>
focussed on the letterboxing community.<br/>
<br/>
I would be interested in feedback, ideas, suggestions about setting <br/>
up the letterboxing site(s) and any comments or interest anyone has <br/>
in the commercial possibilities. <br/>
<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-792471043">Dear Ralph - I welcome your interest in letterboxing. Here in New<br/>
Zealand it's a fledgling pasttime, but overseas it has been<br/>
played for over 150 years. It has never been commercialised, and there<br/>
is strong resistance in the international community to do so. <br/>
<br/>
I have a number of comments about your ideas:<br/>
1) There is already a non-profit website for letterboxing in NZ. Along<br/>
with the AQ website, the Psychokiwi website has coverage of 99% of<br/>
publically-available letterbox clues in NZ. <br/>
2) Placers hold copyright on their letterbox clues so you would need<br/>
to obtain permission from them before using them for commercial<br/>
purposes. I suggest placing your own letterboxes.<br/>
3) Although I can see how a "treasure-hunt" type game would be fun for<br/>
corporate learning games (cooperation and all that...), I don't<br/>
see how letterboxing would be a particularly good way of doing that<br/>
because of all the additional "baggage" of carving stamps, making<br/>
logbooks, and the swapping of stamp images when finding a letterbox.<br/>
Letterboxing suits a minority of people who enjoy arty-crafty<br/>
activities and the great outdoors. In my experience, the majority of<br/>
people find letterboxing a bit geeky. I would think that a<br/>
treasure-hunt without the stamping and logbooks would be more suited<br/>
to what you're trying to do. Of course this is not "letterboxing"<br/>
anymore.<br/>
4) An alternative, that might work is to do geo-caching instead (the<br/>
same points above still hold re copyright). Or orienteering? Both<br/>
pasttimes are far more estabished in NZ, and you don't have to worry<br/>
about the arty-crafty side of things.<br/>
<br/>
I get the impression that you have not actually tried letterboxing<br/>
yourself. If you did go and find some boxes, I think you'd see what I<br/>
mean.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>

<div> </div>
<div>Thanks very much for your detailed feedback.  You have raised quite a few issues re commercialisation that I wasn't aware of such as copyright.  Of course, a commercial version would be localised and suited to the participants so I had expected that we would have to make and hide our own boxes but I hadn't considered the arty-crafty side of things.  You are probably right, what I am proposing is more akin to treasure hunting so its back to the drawing board for ideas now.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Thanks again,</div>
