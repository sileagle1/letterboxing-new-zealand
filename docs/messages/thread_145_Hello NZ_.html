<br/>
We arrived in NZ from the United States on Monday and have looked for 4 <br/>
boxes so far.  We found 3 of the 4 (couldn't find the Roy Rogers box on <br/>
Godley Head near Christchurch, but the clues had warned it might be <br/>
missing, so we were not too surpised to come up empty handed). We also <br/>
planted a new box near Lake Tekapo and the clues for the box are now <br/>
listed on both www.letterboxing.org and AtlasQuest.  <br/>
<br/>
We were surprised to discover how few people have logged into some of <br/>
the boxes.  The box in Clyde was placed 3.5 years ago, but we were only <br/>
the 3rd group to stamp in!<br/>
<br/>
We have 4 more boxes to place before we return home on DEC 7, and <br/>
hopefully someone will visit each of them within the next year...<br/>

years ago, and I was surprised then that it hadn't been found more.  <br/>
If you make it to Tongariro on the North Island, check out our "Kiwi <br/>
Crossing" letterbox.  Hopefully it's still there since we placed it a <br/>
couple of years ago and haven't been back yet.  Enjoy your trip! Such <br/>
a beautiful place *sigh*<br/>
