<br/>
I have just found out about geocaching and letterboxing and am kean <br/>
to get started.  Will start of probably going to realy easy <br/>
geocaching sites until we get a gps and get a stamp.  Husband wants <br/>
to just buy one so we can start stright away I would prefer to make <br/>
one.<br/>
<br/>
We have two boys aged two and almost four and can't wait to <br/>
go 'treasure hunting' with them.<br/>
<br/>
I am learning how to quilt and scrapbook, love needlework (don't get <br/>
much done), occasional baking.<br/>
<br/>
Once we are a bit more up on the play will start placing boxes as <br/>
there are hardly any letterboxes down this way just geocaches.  I <br/>
think letterboxing sounds better as you get to keep a record of all <br/>
the places you have been and each has its own stamp next to it.<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to finding lots of boxes and hopefully meeting <br/>
some/all of you at some stage.  Do let me know if you are coming our <br/>
way.<br/>
<br/>

<div>I am also learning scrapbooking, and look forward to using our letterboxing stamps for those, but would also like to make my own dual purpose (letterboxing/scrapbooking) stamps.  Can't wait to hear how you get on.
