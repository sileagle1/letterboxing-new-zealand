I've read about letterboxing before and then I forgot to follow up <br/>
about it.  I was just reminded today and found this group. Wahoo!<br/>

I live in Lower Hutt, New Zealand and I'm completely new to letter <br/>
boxing.  I'm keen to get started though so I will go and find the <br/>
list of placed boxes and get myself a stamp pad and notebook :-)<br/>

I've talked to my fiance and he is starting to get cautiously <br/>
enthusiatic.  We're planning on our first hunt on Sunday.  Off to <br/>
look for the one at Kaitoke.<br/>
<br/>
I've bought the lino cutting set from whitcoulls that someone else <br/>
mentioned (25% off this week too :-) ) and I've had a go at eraser <br/>
carving.  I'm going to have to practise a bit though!  The first one <br/>
was going okay until I chopped the cats whiskers and half of his face <br/>
off!  I might just try a hand-carved initials and a store bought <br/>
stamp combo until I get a bit better at the carving.  I've got a <br/>
little notebook for the stamps.<br/>
<br/>
Michael (my fiance) is quite interested in the placing of boxes, so <br/>
I'll try to encourage him.<br/>
It'd be good to get some more boxes out there so that new people can <br/>
have enough boxes to "get addicted!" on.<br/>
<br/>
Bye for now!<br/>

</span></blockquote>I'm boring in that I tend to just write the date and location and sometimes<br/>
the person/group that made the box. On occasion I've written more - for<br/>
instance if I've found a box with no clues (once you've been boxing a while<br/>
you can kind of just sniff them out - but that really only works in<br/>
box-dense areas like Connecticut and Dartmoor which have boxes under every<br/>
rock). Others keep their logbooks more like a travel journal. I've also<br/>
heard of folk who always take photos to go with the entry. Others don't keep<br/>
a logbook but stamp onto index cards. Some just stamp the clue sheet.<br/>
<br/>
So it's basically a very personal thing.<br/>

It is nice to hear from a new letterboxer.  Letterboxing has lots of <br/>
artistic qualities that I think you'll enjoy (looking at your other <br/>
arty hobbies).<br/>
<br/>
There are some other letterboxers in Auckland and they've hidden a <br/>
few boxes around the place.  Have you checked out atlasquest.com or <br/>
psychokiwis website yet?<br/>
<br/>
I'm from Wellington, but my husband and I are on our honeymoon at <br/>

<br/>
I'll look forward to hearing from you again...<br/>

&gt; &gt; I'm just brand new to letterboxing and this group.  My brother-in-<br/>
&gt; law<br/>
&gt; &gt; and his family introduced us to geocaching during there recent<br/>
&gt; trip to<br/>
&gt; &gt; NZ from Nth Carolina.  They left us with their GPS to help get us<br/>
&gt; &gt; going.   While I was looking for local caches around Auckland I<br/>
&gt; &gt; discovered one that made reference to letterboxing so I had to find <br/>
&gt; &gt; out more, and here I am.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I'm into crafts of all sorts but mainly paper crafts like card<br/>
&gt; making,<br/>
&gt; &gt; book making, ATCs (that's artists trading cards not air or army <br/>
&gt; &gt; training corps), stamping and calligraphy although I also like<br/>
&gt; playing<br/>
&gt; &gt; with polymer clay - thats du kit and sculpy and have I been known<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; splash paint on paper every now and again. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; We haven't been much into outdoors things except walking (to try<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; keep fit) but that's changing with out introduction to geocaching.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Well that's me. <br/>

europe.  I have my eye on one in Scotland, one in Prague, and some <br/>
in Paris.<br/>

I'm really looking forward to checking out boxes that are around. I<br/>
have been to the websites you suggested and that's how I discovered<br/>
this group.<br/>
<br/>
I have my stamp, ink pad and book at the ready.  Went on a little<br/>
caching exercise the other day.  I was going shopping but took a<br/>
detour - that's the second time i've done that, still it was only<br/>
groceries and I hate grocery shopping.  Anyway, I found the<br/>
cache/letterbox ok but I had left my stampy things at home. I logged<br/>
my cache find but I shall be returning to the spot this weekend<br/>
providing there is a long enough break in the weather to complete my<br/>
first letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy the rest of your honeymoon.  <br/>
Ann<br/>

&gt; Hi Ann!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It is nice to hear from a new letterboxer.  Letterboxing has lots of <br/>
&gt; artistic qualities that I think you'll enjoy (looking at your other <br/>
&gt; arty hobbies).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There are some other letterboxers in Auckland and they've hidden a <br/>
&gt; few boxes around the place.  Have you checked out atlasquest.com or <br/>
&gt; psychokiwis website yet?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'm from Wellington, but my husband and I are on our honeymoon at <br/>
&gt; the moment and we are staying on Dartmoor - the home of letterboxing.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'll look forward to hearing from you again...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Regards,<br/>
&gt; <br/>

I've been taking a break from letterboxing lately, but just today went and <br/>
found a letterbox/cache hybrid in Ashburton.  <br/>
