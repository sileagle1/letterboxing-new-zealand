for popping into letterboxes because they are small and cheap ($3.95 
each).</font></span></div>

Yes, they do have a great range of inkpads.  I'll be sure to tell <br/>
them that I'm a letterboxer next time I'm in the shop.  Carving <br/>
matter would be good.  I haven't seen anything other than erasers <br/>
around town.<br/>
