<br/>
The majority of the boxes in NZ are traveller friendly b/c I think many of<br/>
us are placing boxes when we're travelling around the country already. The<br/>
exception is some of the Wellington boxes, which are more likely to be<br/>
mystery boxes and maybe require a little research or local knowledge to<br/>
solve; some are around 1-3 hours walk up and down steep hills too so you<br/>
don't want to plan to do too many in a day. If you let us know how long<br/>
you'll be in Wellington, we can recommend which ones you'd have time to do.<br/>
<br/>
How are you travelling? If you're doing the campervan thing then some of the<br/>
boxes are at camp sites, which could be handy.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>

our quieter list members like Bruce or Anita would like to come too for an<br/>
exchange and meet n greet.<br/>
<br/>
Do let us know when and where you'll be.  I'd love to meet up and, yes,<br/>
perhaps do a box exchange. You'll have to give me some idea of a suitable<br/>
theme for Moab.  The one I did for Esmerelda was recently hidden as "Kiwi<br/>
Camping in Colorado", so maybe a similar theme?<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to it already..<br/>

hiking, mountain biking, jeeping, ATVing. . .need I go on?  We'll <br/>
definitely have a few boxes to trade for those interested!  It would <br/>
