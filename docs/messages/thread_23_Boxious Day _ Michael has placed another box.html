did it by himself, so that means it is another box I can add to my own list<br/>
to go and find.  Check Atlasquest for the link.<br/>

Today we went to Brooklyn to tackle psychokiwis 2-box EyeSpy Series.  We<br/>
also had 2 geocaches in the same area to look for.  The day was perfect for<br/>
a long walk up at Brooklyn because the wind was non-existent and the day<br/>
wasn't hot.  The Turbine had ground to a halt and was waiting for more wind<br/>
to set it going again.  We headed off down the road and during our three-ish<br/>
hour walk encountered lots of interesting things. Lovely views all the way<br/>
along of the south island mountain ranges, the harbour and the straight, the<br/>
rimutakas....<br/>
<br/>
We walked past an ostrich farm and there was a wonderful photo opportunity.<br/>
I'll see if I can upload a photo somehow.  Further along we found the first<br/>
letterbox, "post-modern sculpture".  We walked past a huge "castle"<br/>
(www.castlewellington.co.nz) that we ogled through the wirelink fence.<br/>
<br/>
Heard some Bleats and noticed a little family of goats, complete with little<br/>
kids.  Michael started joking around and singing "high in the hills there's<br/>
a lonely goatherd - yodalady yodalady yodalady hoo" from Sound of Music.<br/>
Hehehehe.<br/>
<br/>
Then onto the Radome, a white spherical building that just looks odd!  Like<br/>
as if aliens landed in it or something.  Hidden nearby there was the<br/>
geocache "Hawkins Radome" which we found.<br/>
<br/>
Headed on further.  We passed a dead ferret on the road, I was surprised to<br/>
see it because I forget that we have those in NZ, only seem to remember the<br/>
rabbit or possums.  (we saw some possums in trees on the way back).Finally<br/>
got to the puffball box and stamped in.<br/>
<br/>
Just as we were stamping in I noticed some white flaky stuff...hmm...then I<br/>
realised it was snowing!  Well, I suppose it is over 400 metres up there on<br/>
Hawkins Hill, but I was still surprised.  The snow softly fell as we walked<br/>
back to the carpark, never getting too voluminous or scary.<br/>
<br/>
Back at the carpark we found the geocache "Brooklyn Blades".  I was thrilled<br/>
to find a travelbug in the cache (equivalent to a lb hitchhiker).  So now I<br/>
have to figure out where to release the little guy.<br/>
<br/>
THANKS PSYCHOKIWIS.  Michael and I had a wonderful day with heaps of fun<br/>
adventures.<br/>
