<br/>
Since we last visited this list we have placed three boxes, and <br/>
thanks to Judi's eagle eyes, our Rarotonga box and our mystery box <br/>
have made it onto the 'official list'.  Thanks :)<br/>
<br/>
Today we placed another box in Te Kauwhata (slight spelling mistake <br/>
on Atlas Quest!) but may have to change the location in future.<br/>
<br/>
I see you have all been busy too, which is very exciting.  We're <br/>
looking forward to seeing what you all have placed in 2005.<br/>

any like that, let him know and he'll change them over.<br/>
