&gt; Had a wonderful boxious day today. The weather was lovely so we took off<br/>
&gt; this afternoon and went to find Chaucey &amp; Michael's first box Under the<br/>
&gt; Leafy Trees. It's a lovely spot and spring has obviously sprung - we met a<br/>
&gt; grey warbler with his beak full of nesting material, piwakawaka were<br/>
&gt; fluttering through the clematis, and the tui were chattering away. Thanks<br/>
&gt; guys for sharing this spot.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We also placed a box - will try and get clues up tonight.<br/>

<br/>
</span></blockquote>The clues seemed to work just fine - I actually scribbled down notes rather<br/>
than print out the page (I was too lazy to go upstairs and turn the printer<br/>
on) so any uncertainties we had were probably due to my cryptic scribbles.<br/>
My only suggestion would be to also use ziplock-style plastic bags to<br/>
protect the logbook (I usually carry spares, but didn't have one on me).<br/>
Your box was fine - perfectly dry inside - but I don't know longterm how<br/>
waterproof those boxes are so  I like to double or even triple protect<br/>
against moisture. Bags also protect against the ink pad leaking. We have<br/>
found too many sodden, wet, and even horribly mouldy letterboxes - and NZ is<br/>
much wetter than Connecticut.<br/>
<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1929294166">Yes.  Good idea.  We bought some big ziplock bags to put the whole <br/>
box into.  So when we go and check on our boxes next time we <br/>
will "upgrade" with bags (and maybe little baggies for the log book <br/>
and another for the inkpad).<br/>
I'm hoping the sistema boxes will be good because they have a rubber <br/>
seal in them.<br/>
<br/>
Michael carved a stamp last night all by himself.  He has the bug!  <br/>
He's going to hide that box without me so I get an extra one to go <br/>
and find.<br/>
