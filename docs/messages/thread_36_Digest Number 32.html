Yay...I was vaguely thinking of going to Kaikoura over labour weekend to see <br/>
if the Little Shag letterbox was still there - so now there will be two to <br/>
hunt out if we do end up going :) Plus there is the letterbox/geocache <br/>
hybrid at Glentui, so it could be a good "Girls' Day Out" for my daughter &amp; <br/>
I.<br/>
<br/>
I have several locations in mind for Christchurch &amp; the surrounding areas. <br/>
Plus we go to Hanmer quite a bit, so will be installing one there next time <br/>
we're up. I have discovered in the last couple of days that finding <br/>
locations isn't going to be hard - it's avoiding all the geocaches that seem <br/>
to be so prolific in Chch that's going to be the problem (oh, to have a GPS <br/>
unit)!<br/>
<br/>

&gt;Hi Amy - sorry for the delay in your messages coming through - I need to<br/>
&gt;manually approve new member postings (a ploy to reduce spam) but I was away<br/>
&gt;all weekend. The good news for you is that we were holidaying in the South<br/>
&gt;Island and have placed SIX new boxes - the closest to you being in <br/>
&gt;Kaikoura.<br/>
&gt;Watch this space - clues coming soon.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So glad to hear you found the YEP - it is one of the oldest boxes I know of<br/>
&gt;in NZ.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Any questions, feel free to ask here or you can also email me privately.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So glad to hear we have a boxer in the South Island now!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Cheers,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Judi<br/>

</span></blockquote>I've just sat down to start on the clues for all the boxes we put out. If<br/>
you end up going to Kaikoura before I've "officially" done the clues, send<br/>
me an email and I'll send an advanced copy of the clues. Kaikoura is a<br/>
fabulous place for boxing because it is so rocky - there is definitely more<br/>
scope for putting out boxes in the "shag" area so go prepared!! Other spots<br/>
in NZ can be much more tricky. The tops of hills (which Wellington excels<br/>
at) tend to be pretty bare, the ground tends to be clay rather than rocks,<br/>
and the trees tend to be pines which don't have as many nooks and crannies.<br/>
We also had more trouble finding spots in the Blenheim region - but we<br/>
persevered and got all our boxes out!<br/>
<br/>
Yes there are far more geo-caches in NZ - last time I looked there was over<br/>
300 but there is probably many more now. You'll find that many geo-caches<br/>
can be done without a GPS :-D<br/>
I don't think it's a problem to use locations where there are geo-caches,<br/>
but you want to make sure your box is well away from the geo-cache and that<br/>
it is clearly labelled that it's a letterbox (there is a flyer in the yahoo<br/>
files section you could print out and include in the box). There have been<br/>
many occassions in the states where geo-cachers have found a nearby<br/>
letterbox and have taken the stamp thinking that it was treasure. :-(<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
