Kaitoke Regional Park (about 45 minutes drive from Wellington). It's not a<br/>
LotR theme box though. My cousin's husband also runs a tourist venture on<br/>
his farm in Matamata where they filmed all the Hobbiton scenes - even the<br/>
toilets are shaped like little Hobbit houses. I haven't put a box there, but<br/>
there is another one (Bulls Eye) about 15 minutes away in Te Poi. There is<br/>
the Lord of the Rings location guidebook, which is a must if you're planning<br/>
a LotR-themed vacation. One source is<br/>

Here in Wellington, there is Weta Studios (but I don't know if they do tours<br/>
- probably not), and even the airport has a giant-size Golem there to greet<br/>
you when you fly in!<br/>
<br/>
The Playmakers from Canada put out 5 boxes in some touristy spots all around<br/>
the country. There are so many wonderful places you could visit. The weather<br/>
here can be quite changeable so it would be a good idea to have some<br/>
flexibility and contingency plans built in.<br/>

Get out of my mind! LOL  Ever since I decided to visit there, ideas <br/>
of boxes have been rumbling around my head.  I am a huge fan, so have <br/>
lots of ideas for stamps and would be glad to give you some ideas. <br/>
<br/>
I'm working on a Gollum box now for the Monster Mash..and I've spent <br/>
way too much time on it but I'm having a total blast. Which of course <br/>
is going to lead into a bunch of the other characters. I've already <br/>
got my artwork for the next stamp (Nazgul) started. <br/>
<br/>
There are a few places there where pivotal scenes were filmed,which <br/>
makes them perfect for either a character stamp or something to do <br/>
with that point in the story. There is the possibility for a <br/>
wonderful series! <br/>
<br/>
 I'd be glad to take any with me to hide, and I bet Judi would hide <br/>
some, too! I won't be going until next year, but I figure that gives <br/>
me time to carve a suitcase full of boxes. :::laughs:::<br/>
<br/>
You know letterboxing, I know the movies/books. Just tell me what you <br/>
want to know!  <br/>

That farm belongs to your cousin's husband?!  That is certainly a <br/>
place I want to visit. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the link to the book.. it is on it's way to me even as we <br/>
speak. I'm sure it will be a huge help in planning out my trip.  I <br/>
don't feel quite so lost now.<br/>
<br/>
Have you found all the New Zealand boxes?  <br/>
<br/>
For Colorado boxes you have many possibilities. I live in western <br/>
Colorado (Grand Junction). We are in the Grand Valley...surrounded by <br/>
mountains, mesa, rivers, canyons.. and desert!  We have hiking, <br/>
rafting, camping, fishing, skiing, Indian ruins and writings, the <br/>
Continental Divide, wild horses, cowboys... too much to list.  One <br/>
thing we have in common is sheep, and I imagine sheep dogs.  The <br/>
national finals of the sheep dog trials is near here.. I was planning <br/>
on planting a box there this year. You can find it at <br/>
<a href="http://www.meekersheepdog.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.meekersheepdog.com</a> <br/>
<br/>
I wander all over Colorado, so if you want something planted on the <br/>
other side of the state, that's not a problem.  We're a fairly young <br/>
letterboxing state, so the boxes are few and far between right now <br/>
and we'd love to adopt some of your's. You also might think about a <br/>
hitchhiker. <br/>

&gt; &gt; I totally love this idea!  I have to admit, however, I'm not really<br/>
&gt; a <br/>
&gt; &gt; big LOTR fan and don't really know much about the story.  I don't<br/>
&gt; &gt; really 'get' those fantasy kind of stories, so I'm not really the <br/>
&gt; &gt; best person for 'technical advice' when it comes to LOTR!  But <br/>
&gt; &gt; letterboxes--now I know about letterboxes!  =)  I'd be willing to <br/>
&gt; &gt; help carve stamps and such, but I'd need some direction on what <br/>
&gt; &gt; should be carved.  And writing the clue--I couldn't possibily do <br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; &gt; kind of clue I have in mind justice.  That flowery writing doesn't<br/>
&gt; &gt; come well to me, but others are *really* good at that sort of thing!<br/>
