together?<br/>
<br/>
I really want to show off my dartmoor photos and my logbook!<br/>
<br/>
Gotta do something to keep the letterboxing parts of our brains alert <br/>
over winter!<br/>
<br/>
I'd like to suggest a dinner or supper at my house in Lower Hutt.  <br/>
maybe next month?  Email me or reply here if you are keen.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps I'm being a bit naughty and trying to procrastinate doing some <br/>
box maintenance and the placing of Kennamtn and Rivergeeks box.  I <br/>
promise it'll be soon!<br/>

would have loved to meet someone from the group, but being in Ak is<br/>
just a tad too far to come for dinner ;-)<br/>

Maybe next time we're in Wgtn.<br/>
