I am in the process of setting up 26 boxes in the Tongariro region (each with a different letter of the alphabet in the box). Currently I am posting them on Atlas Quest as they are planted. There are 4 listed already. <br/>
<br/>
Background: <br/>
I have made and given boxes out to friends with instructions on where to plant them and when they have planted them and returned the clues to us, Jim and I go out to find them. This is part of Jim's birthday present. It has certainly got a few of our friends into letterboxing.</div>
