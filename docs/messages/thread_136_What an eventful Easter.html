                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1442960671">Well our intentions were to pick up a campervan in Christchurch, find <br/>
Native YEP, head north to Geocache event at Springs Junction and then <br/>
return home via Greymouth.<br/>
<br/>
It did not start out well.  Getting boys dressed in the morning <br/>
youngest had very messy nappy (and the smell).  Do we still go? Yes <br/>
says husband we have payed for it we have plenty of disposable <br/>
nappies we will cope.  Did a drive by Travel Bug cache near <br/>
Christchurch airport and picked up campervan.  Half an hour worth of <br/>
instructions (and we still never got the cooker to work) on to <br/>
friends place to pack our things into the campervan and leave our car <br/>
behind.  Must have taken an hour (yes we had too much stuff for the <br/>
space available).<br/>
No time for any hunts have to get on the road.  So close!!  Only the <br/>
second time we have been to Chch since we learnt about letterboxing <br/>
and geocaching and to get so close (only a couple of kilometers.<br/>
<br/>
Headed north occasionaly stopping for a strech of legs and hunt found <br/>
some missed some and got to Hanmer Springs were not going to stay <br/>
here but changed our minds as everyone was tired.  No freedom camping <br/>
so luckily got a powered site but only because of a cancelation by <br/>
someone else.  Got the last spot available.  Campervan still not very <br/>
orgainised takeaways for dinner as boys very hungry to bed as soon as <br/>
it was dark for everyone.<br/>
<br/>
About 3am woken to crying as oldest son (4 years old) had throwen <br/>
up.  Was not feeling best myself.  Boys would not sleep up the top <br/>
any more so 4 sleeping in space designed for two adults with car <br/>
seats taking up vital foot space.  About twenty minutes later I was <br/>
outside being sick too.<br/>
<br/>
This sets the scene for our weekend woken every night about the same <br/>
time for either someone being sick or dirty nappy.  Husband was the <br/>
only one to escape.  Boys fine during day just sick at night time.<br/>
<br/>
Meet up with everyone just east of Springs Junction.  Had a swarm of <br/>
sandflys around me all the time.  Had candles burning in the camper <br/>
van to try and keep them out as best we could.  Blew them out and set <br/>
of.... It was not long before we heard a crash and there was wax over <br/>
a large area!  Too late now, picked candle up and continued on our <br/>
way.<br/>
<br/>
Add in my trip to Reefton hospital Saturday night because of tooth <br/>
ache.  After shot in backside and a number of different tablest went <br/>
back to camping ground feeling improved.  Boys finaly had dinner some <br/>
time around 7:30.  No I did not eat.<br/>
<br/>
Ended up last night staying not far from Oxford and remember there <br/>
was a hybrid letterbox near by.  Did I want to find it or wait till I <br/>
had found Native YEP first.  Oh the delema, not for long as I found I <br/>
had left the information sheet at home.  So once again very close but <br/>
might as well have been miles away as we had no chance of finding it.<br/>
<br/>
Arrived back in Christchurch made the swap of vehicles and was given <br/>
a delicous lunch.  No I won't have any, oh just a little and peaches <br/>
and cream.  Home grown peaches freshly cooked just for me last light, <br/>
ok just a little.  Not a good idea not feeling the best husband can <br/>
you drive please.<br/>
<br/>
Dropped husband at work by which stage I was feeling better after a <br/>
sleep in the car and could drive.  Dinner that night was boiled egg <br/>
and slice of toast each for the two boys and I had nothing.<br/>
<br/>
So yes we did have an excellent weekend despite all of the above and <br/>
attended our first event and found 12 caches and went to a number of <br/>
places we would not have if we hadn't been treasure hunting.<br/>
<br/>
Still having problems with my teeth apointment number two with <br/>
dentist on Monday the 30th and still no letterbox finds!!<br/>
At least I know with my husbands soccer team traveling to <br/>
Christchurch for games just about every other week I have plenty of <br/>
opportunity to find it.  First game today at home (Ashburton).<br/>
<br/>
Sorry this is sooooo long but it was a very eventfull weekend.  One I <br/>
don't think we will forget in a while.</div>
