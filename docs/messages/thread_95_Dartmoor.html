Michael and I have booked our honeymoon.  It is six weeks in Europe. <br/>
One of the things we are doing is renting a cottage in Dartmoor for a <br/>

Yes - That Dartmoor!  Home of letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
We'll be there in late May.  I've tried to compile a list of clues <br/>
from the internet (eg boxes in pubs/shops, well known boxes, well <br/>
known "scavenger sites" etc..), but if anyone knows of a good <br/>
information source then I'd love to know.<br/>

Judi.  So I guess you've been there before?<br/>
Did you enjoy it?  The only thing that worries me is that the hiking <br/>

I have the OS map, but even theough I do orienteering (I'm a <br/>
beginner) I have a bad sense of scale.<br/>

It's such an amazing place - very atmospheric. It is a huge area though<br/>
there are plenty of boxes within a few minutes walk from the roads (which<br/>
can be amazingly narrow and quaint - with sheep asleep on them in the middle<br/>
of the night!). I'd suggest trying to hook up with locals for the longer<br/>
walks, b/c the moors can be quite dangerous if you're not familiar with<br/>
them. We didn't do "the" letterbox (ie the very first one at Cranmere Pond)<br/>
b/c it was too long a walk for me, especially given the short time we were<br/>
there. Also, there aren't that many convenient conveniences around the moors<br/>
and it is very wide open so no ducking behind a tree. When you're exploring<br/>
around the tors for boxes, do beware of the tissues - especially the yellow<br/>
ones... (the tors are the only spots where you at least have 180degrees<br/>
protection and privacy!).<br/>
<br/>
And trust me - when you get home you'll need to go through the declaration<br/>
line at customs - Dartmoor is covered in animal poop as far as the eye can<br/>
see. You cannot walk around it - there is just too much of it!!! If you wash<br/>
your shoes, hiking poles, etc in disinfectant before you leave it won't be<br/>
too much hassle at the airport. You have been warned :-)))<br/>
