The landscape around the observation platform has changed a bit since <br/>
you hid the box and you might need to update your clues, but we'll <br/>

Another reason to go back I suppose!<br/>

clues. We placed it in late summer and the trek wasn't too bad, but I can<br/>
imagine how boggy it must have been in places in spring. I hope you get to<br/>
go back on a fine day - it's a magical spot. If you do go back, do consider<br/>
doing a tag-along box so we have something to find next time we do a box<br/>
check :-)<br/>

P.S. Were you guys the first finders?<br/>
