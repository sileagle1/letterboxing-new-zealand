They are meetup.com members for Letterboxing in Wgtn.<br/>

It'd be great to connect them up with this board, then it might <br/>
enthuse them enough to start participating.  I'll try leaving a <br/>

about 4 lurkers on this list (not including the shy and retiring Linton!)<br/>
but they don't seem to be the same folk. I'm hoping one day our lurkers will<br/>
say Hi and that one day we'll start seeing their stamps appear in some<br/>
letterboxes :-)))<br/>
