The clues are easy to follow and its a great walk with beautiful views all around - suggest anyone - even beginners, should give this one a try. (Its only our second box, so it cant be that hard). Surprised to see a Geocacher somehow found it in 2010 although I cant find coordinates listed on Geocaching.com website. I'm not sure if the Lamb family are looking after this now as they have not been active on AQ for awhile. We will try to keep an eye on it as it is not too far from our home. <a href="http://www.atlasquest.com/showinfo.html?gBoxId=2667" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.atlasquest.com/showinfo.html?gBoxId=2667</a></div>
