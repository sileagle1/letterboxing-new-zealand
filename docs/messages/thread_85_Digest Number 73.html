<br/>
I tried to email you back when I first visited this letterbox last year but <br/>
I think it might have been to the email address that is in the letterbox &amp; <br/>
maybe not one you're using any more?<br/>
<br/>
This letterbox is still there &amp; fine. In fact, I visited it again before I <br/>
left New Zealand.<br/>
<br/>
It was a bit wet when I visited it in October (4 years after it was <br/>
originally placed!) but I cleaned it out &amp; rebagged everything &amp; dried out <br/>
the container as much as I could. It's a brilliant spot, very peaceful &amp; <br/>
very  well hidden - no chance of someone finding it accidentally.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hello,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Back in 2001 my wife and I visited the South Island and placed a<br/>
&gt;letter box in Canterbury.  It's called "Native YEP".<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Can anyone confirm for me that this box is still active and is the<br/>
&gt;login book still around?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If you have any information and would please send us an email at<br/>
&gt;<a href="mailto:nomad_pnw@..." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">nomad_pnw@...</a>, that would be really great.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

You are correct, the email included in the box is no longer valid.  <br/>

No problem on including the box link on your website.  You can leave <br/>
the link to the LBNA or copy the clues to a new location and link to <br/>
it there.<br/>
<br/>
I didn't know about the AtlasQuest site but will check it out.  All <br/>
of our placed boxes have been lost except for the NZ one and a small <br/>
series in Portland.  But we have found over 100 boxes so guess we <br/>
will earn a place in the ranks at the AtlasQuest site.   <br/>
<br/>
One regret I have is the message I left in the box, that asks folks <br/>
to email us and let us know how the box is doing because I left an <br/>
email address that is now defunct.  Perhaps on the clues on your <br/>
site you could make a note that this is the case and have them email <br/>
us at:  <br/>
<br/>
<a href="mailto:nomad_pnw@..." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">nomad_pnw@...</a><br/>
<br/>
...instead.  It would be fun to continue to hear who finds the box <br/>
and how it is doing.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

&gt; No problem on including the box link on your website.  You can leave <br/>
&gt; the link to the LBNA or copy the clues to a new location and link to <br/>
&gt; it there.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I didn't know about the AtlasQuest site but will check it out.  All <br/>
&gt; of our placed boxes have been lost except for the NZ one and a small <br/>
&gt; series in Portland.  But we have found over 100 boxes so guess we <br/>
&gt; will earn a place in the ranks at the AtlasQuest site.   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; One regret I have is the message I left in the box, that asks folks <br/>
&gt; to email us and let us know how the box is doing because I left an <br/>
&gt; email address that is now defunct.  Perhaps on the clues on your <br/>
&gt; site you could make a note that this is the case and have them email <br/>
&gt; us at:  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <a href="mailto:nomad_pnw@..." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">nomad_pnw@...</a><br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ...instead.  It would be fun to continue to hear who finds the box <br/>
&gt; and how it is doing.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks,<br/>

Thanks for posting the clues for us.  Perhaps two slight changes <br/>
would be good.  Change our email contact address from what it once <br/>
was to "nomad_pnw at hotmail.com", replacing the "at" with an "@".  <br/>
I had to write it that way or this program would have concealed it <br/>
again.<br/>
<br/>
Also, please add "Hillsboro, Oregon  USA" below our names, or beside <br/>
them however it works.<br/>
<br/>
As for the Atlas Quest site, it's my understanding that unless the <br/>
true owner submits their own letterboxes, the site will assume the <br/>
person entering the clues has "adopted" the box.  I told Ryan he <br/>
should change the system so others can enter boxes without having to <br/>
adopt them.  One issue we face with his site is that most of our <br/>
boxes were found in the easter USA, and since they aren't logged in, <br/>
they don't get a count per his system.  Boo, hiss, lol.  Maybe one <br/>
more small nudge from someone in NZ to him about this would help <br/>
convince him of the needed change.  <br/>
<br/>
However, I guess having someone from NZ watch over our box is a <br/>
pretty good idea.  So how would you like to adopt our box and take <br/>
care of it for us?  We'd still like to be kept in the loop as to how <br/>
it does but it's pretty tough to give it TLC from North America-ha!<br/>

But if you sign up with AQ, even if you don't enter any boxes, I can then<br/>
adopt Native YEP but still link to you as the owner, but I can only do that<br/>
if you have a profile.<br/>

know.  ;o)<br/>
<br/>
In other news, I've updated the site so you can start recording your<br/>
own boxes as finds if that's any consolation.  The changes aren't on<br/>
the live site yet--I just made them today on my test machine.  But you<br/>
can start recording more finds that way!<br/>
<br/>
On the downside, they don't actually contribute to your PFX counts. <br/>
It's allowed only so you can update the "last found" information on<br/>
your box if you happen to check up on it.<br/>
