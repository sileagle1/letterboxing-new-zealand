north of San Francisco) for a year.  I love carving and planting and <br/>
have planted almost 100 boxes so far.  I brought carving medium, <br/>
logbooks and tupperware, but so far have ben so busy with being a <br/>
tourist I have not had time to carve or plant here....but tomoorow <br/>
myhusband is spending the day with a flyfish guide and maybe I will <br/>
have down time to do some then.  <br/>
<br/>
What a gorgeous country you have here!  And everyone has been so <br/>
friendly and welcoming.  <br/>
