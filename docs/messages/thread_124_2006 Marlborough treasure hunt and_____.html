that might be of interest to letterboxers as similar activities.<br/>
<br/>
The Marlborough treasure hunt is on again this year, 3rd of June <br/>
2006.  I really want to enter - looks like heaps of fun and the <br/>
puzzling and travelling about reminds me of <br/>
letterboxing.<a href="http://www.treasurehunt.co.nz/default.asp" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.treasurehunt.co.nz/default.asp</a><br/>
<br/>
Also, the (wellington) City Safari event that Michael and I <br/>
participated in last year is on again this year, 20th May. It is like <br/>
orienteering but public transport use is encouraged.<br/>

<br/>
I'm feeling more enthusiastic now - did some geocaching this week, and <br/>
some orienteering and think I'd like to fit in some letterboxing <br/>
soon.  Tried to do a virtual lb online and got a bit stuck &lt;grin&gt;</div>

<br/>
Those both sound like fun!  A bit far for us to travel, but if you <br/>
participate I hope you enjoy them...<br/>
<br/>
We got a card in our mailbox yesterday telling us we had a package to <br/>
collect... shame it was a Saturday so the Post Office was closed.  <br/>
We're hoping it's the box you sent us (and if not then an unexpected <br/>
package should hopefully be something good!)<br/>
