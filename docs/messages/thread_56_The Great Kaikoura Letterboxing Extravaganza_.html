Little Shag was easy enough to find &amp; made a pleasant beginning to the<br/>

Just a note to anyone else who does these in the future (&amp; I hope this<br/>

heading out if you want to do this in less than 2 hours...otherwise<br/>
take a towel (if the tide is in) &amp; watch out for basking seals - they<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1407128830">Hi Amy - sounds like you guys had all sorts of adventures! I'm glad you<br/>
found all the boxes and the surprises we left behind. Your advice is very<br/>
good, and applies to all box hunting - and that is to never rely just on the<br/>
clue sheet. Do check out maps, weather forecasts, etc., to ensure you are<br/>
well prepared and know what you're getting into. This is even more true for<br/>
mystery-style boxes where specific instructions may be lacking. Even when<br/>
the clues sound easy, be on the lookout for changes to the landscape and<br/>
tracks. Sometimes a box that is easy in summer maybe impossible in winter.<br/>
You can get into trouble too if you've misinterpreted the clues or if the<br/>
clues are in error and you end up somewhere else - Linton and I have not<br/>
only ended up in the wrong woods but in the wrong county! Oops :-) All adds<br/>
to the letterboxing experience...<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>

It has great advice about Seals which I wish I'd read prior <br/>
(especially about avoiding eye-contact) as one seal really frightened <br/>
me when it looked like it was going to chase me!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Judi and Linton!  You guys are doing wonders for my fitness!!<br/>

I'm pleased to report that my PFX count is now looking pretty <br/>
healthy - P4 F15 X1 HH2.  I also have found 13 geocaches and 3 travel <br/>
bugs!</div>

</span></blockquote>Wow - how far did the seal chase you :-DDD<br/>
There are also signs about saying to stay 10 metres away from the seals<br/>
(i.e., they're basically lazy). I might add a note to the clue sheet to that<br/>
effect!<br/>
<br/>
Did you find all the boxes you set out to find over the weekend?<br/>

that makes you guys the current champion kiwi boxers :-D<br/>

</span></blockquote>Well, the seal was on a ledge and there were cliffs on one side, and <br/>
the sea on the other and only about 3 or 4 metres between me and the <br/>
Seal.  We had been walking for ages and were getting close to our <br/>
destination and DID NOT want to turn back.<br/>
It had a happy ending when the seal got annoyed at us all hanging <br/>
about and mooched off into the sea to find a quieter spot.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Did you find all the boxes you set out to find over the weekend?<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
</span></blockquote>Yes, we did!  We had heaps of fun and it was the best holiday we've <br/>
had.  I think my favourite box was Red Oak Acorns.  Although Taniwha <br/>
was pretty awesome too! <br/>
<br/>
I'm thinking of planning another holiday now (perhaps I'm addicted?) <br/>
to pop around the North Island.  Depends on $ I suppose, as we have a <br/>
Wedding and Honeymoon next year to save for!<br/>
Please let me know what happens with the box at Bulls.  If it truly <br/>
is missing then perhaps I could drop off a replacement or something?<br/>
I also think that Epiphany is going to be busy getting CHCH to <br/>
dominate at Letterboxing the way it does with geocaching - so it <br/>
should be worth a visit in the not too distant future :-)</div>

place wasn't that good and it should have been pretty easy to find if it was<br/>
still there. We'll check next time we're going by (but that may not be until<br/>
next year some time). <br/>
<br/>
I'm assuming that your honeymoon is strategically planned to take in as many<br/>
letterboxes as you can (I see a nice long road trip around NZ.... :-DD<br/>
<br/>
We're long overdue to visit Chch so am looking forward to doing some boxing<br/>
there too!<br/>
