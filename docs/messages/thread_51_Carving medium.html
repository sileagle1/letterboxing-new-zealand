Judi, is this the stuff your shop was bringing in for you? How can we<br/>

it's size, I really wanted some sort of mount to stop it from flexing<br/>

                    <div id="ygrps-yiv-910218733">Yes, Mastercarve is what I use. If you use the 3/4" blocks, rather than the<br/>
1/2" blocks they don't need mounting. That said, I tend to buy the<br/>
4"x4"x1/2" blocks because they work out the cheapest per square inch, and I<br/>
can usually get 2-4 stamps out of one block. I don't know if the shop has<br/>
got any in yet - I haven't run out of my stash yet! With the exchange rate<br/>
being so favourable to NZers now, I'd suggest ordering it in from the USA.<br/>
<br/>
Here is a link to Mastercarve blocks at Dick Blick's (a USA art supply<br/>
store) which is the online shop I used when I lived in the USA:<br/>

Some folk like this stuff better, you can get finer detail but it's a bit<br/>
harder to use and generally needs mounting because its thin.<br/>
<a href="http://www.dickblick.com/zz404/02/products.asp?param=0&amp;ig_id=1862" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.dickblick.com/zz404/02/products.asp?param=0&amp;ig_id=1862</a><br/>
They say they ship overseas: "Outside contiguous U.S., except Alaska,<br/>
Hawaii, and Puerto Rico (see above), will be charged actual shipping<br/>
charges. Please call for charges: 1-800-828-4548 or 1-309-343-6181." but I'd<br/>
be tempted to use their web form first to see if I could save a toll call.<br/>
<br/>
For carving, these handles are incredibly cheap<br/>

and can be easier to use than the chunkier handlers<br/>
<a href="http://www.dickblick.com/zz402/01/products.asp?param=0&amp;ig_id=1847" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.dickblick.com/zz402/01/products.asp?param=0&amp;ig_id=1847</a><br/>
I'd suggest getting 2 or 3 - one for each type of blade you use.<br/>
<br/>
The blades or cutters that are most useful for rubber stamps are<br/>
<a href="http://www.dickblick.com/zz402/03/products.asp?param=0&amp;ig_id=1842" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.dickblick.com/zz402/03/products.asp?param=0&amp;ig_id=1842</a><br/>
Blades 1 (liner), 2 (v-gouge), and 4 (u-gouge). You'll probably find<br/>
v-gouges the most useful. These blades can be sharpened with a sharpening<br/>
stone, but a lot of people will just use a new blade.<br/>
<br/>
There is much discussion and debate over how best to mount stamps. You can<br/>
get the mounting blocks that are used by store-bought rubber stamps, but<br/>
they are expensive. Be careful using a soft or laminated wood like balsa or<br/>
plywood because they can warp if they get wet. If you're lucky enough to<br/>
have a carpenter friend, you may be able to get hold of hardwood cutoffs.<br/>
You also need to take into consideration the extra room taken up in the box<br/>
by the mount. I've occasionally mounted the stamp onto the lid of the stamp<br/>
pad, but again, work out if it will fit in the box before gluing!! Also,<br/>
some glues will eat into the rubber and some will soften when wet. I don't<br/>
have any recommendations sorry. <br/>

I bought the lino cutting set from Whitcoulls &amp; squashed one of the<br/>
larger gouge ends so it made a really fine v-cut as I couldn't get any<br/>
fine details with any of the others.<br/>
<br/>
What glue did you use when gluing yours? I'm pretty sure (well, I<br/>
hope) that the stuff I used will be ok &amp; won't disintigrate the vinyl.<br/>

</span></blockquote>Erasers seem to last well b/c they're small. It depends on how many visitors<br/>
the box gets - I don't think we're in any danger of wearing stamps out just<br/>
yet :-))<br/>
<br/>
One of the key things to stop a stamp from crumbling is to be careful not to<br/>
undercut the raised part of the image when you're carving. It's easy to<br/>
undercut when using a flat xacto blade, but the v-gouge blade ensures a good<br/>
angle.<br/>

if any Coloradians stumbled by they wouldn't have to click on it. I'd love<br/>

that the stamp is so much easier to use if mounted.  We have been <br/>
getting scraps of wood from my parent's woodpile (we don't have much <br/>
call for one of those in our apartment!), sanding them down and then <br/>
polyurethaning them once we have put an image on it.  We use foam to <br/>
cushion the stamp like you can get from a scrapbooking or card making <br/>
store.  The one we have has adhesive on both sides so it sticks to <br/>
the lacquered wood as well as the vinyl.  I guess time will tell if <br/>
it causes any damage...<br/>
